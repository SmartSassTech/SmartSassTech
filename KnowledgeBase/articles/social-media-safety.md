## Understanding Social Media Safety

Think of social media like a public park. Everyone can see what you do there unless you put up a fence (privacy settings). Some people in the park are friendly neighbors, but others might be strangers with bad intentions. This guide helps you build that fence and recognize who's trustworthy.

**The Golden Rule:** If you wouldn't share something with a stranger on the street, don't share it on social media.

## Step 1: Strengthen Your Passwords

Your password is like the key to your house. A weak password is like hiding a key under the doormat—everyone knows to look there.

## Creating a Strong Password

1. Make it at least 12 characters long.
2. Mix uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols (like ! or #).
3. Avoid using your name, birthday, or common words like "password123".
4. Don't use the same password for multiple accounts.

**Good Example:** `BlueSky$2024!Garden`  
**Bad Example:** `john1965` or `password`

## Where to Store Passwords Safely

* **Write them down:** Keep a physical notebook in a safe place at home (not near your computer).
* **Use a password manager:** Apps like LastPass or 1Password store your passwords securely (like a digital safe).
* **Never save them in your phone's notes app:** If someone steals your phone, they'll have access to everything.

## Step 2: Set Up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication is like having two locks on your door instead of one. Even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the second key.

## How to Enable 2FA on Facebook

1. Open the Facebook app and tap the menu (three lines).
2. Scroll down and tap **Settings & Privacy** > **Settings**.
3. Tap **Security and Login**.
4. Scroll to **Two-Factor Authentication** and tap **Use two-factor authentication**.
5. Choose **Text Message (SMS)** or **Authentication App**.
6. Follow the prompts to set it up.

## How to Enable 2FA on Instagram

1. Open Instagram and tap your profile picture (bottom-right).
2. Tap the menu (three lines) and select **Settings and privacy**.
3. Tap **Account Center** > **Password and security**.
4. Tap **Two-factor authentication** and select your account.
5. Choose **Text Message** or **Authentication App** and follow the steps.

**What happens next:** Every time you log in, you'll enter your password, then a special code sent to your phone. This stops hackers even if they know your password.

## Step 3: Lock Down Your Privacy Settings

Privacy settings control who sees what you post. Here's how to make sure only your friends and family see your content.

## Facebook Privacy Settings

1. Open Facebook and tap the menu (three lines).
2. Tap **Settings & Privacy** > **Settings**.
3. Tap **Privacy**.
4. Set **Who can see your future posts?** to **Friends** (not Public).
5. Set **Who can send you friend requests?** to **Friends of friends**.
6. Go back and tap **Profile and Tagging**.
7. Set **Who can post on your profile?** to **Friends**.
8. Set **Review posts you're tagged in** to **On** (so you approve before anything appears).

## Instagram Privacy Settings

1. Open Instagram and tap your profile picture.
2. Tap the menu (three lines) > **Settings and privacy**.
3. Tap **Account Privacy**.
4. Turn on **Private Account** (this means only approved followers see your posts).
5. Go back and tap **Tags and mentions**.
6. Set **Allow tags from** to **People you follow**.

## General Privacy Rules for All Platforms

* **Don't accept friend requests from strangers:** If you don't know them in real life, don't connect with them online.
* **Turn off location services:** Go to your phone's **Settings** > **Apps** > **[Social Media App]** > **Permissions** > turn off **Location**.
* **Review your friends list regularly:** Remove people you no longer trust or recognize.

## 🛡️ Safety Tip: What Never to Share Online

Even with privacy settings, avoid sharing:

* **Your full address or phone number:** Scammers can use this to find you or steal your identity.
* **Your birthdate (including year):** This helps thieves answer security questions.
* **Photos of your credit cards, driver's license, or passport:** Even showing part of the number is dangerous.
* **Vacation plans in advance:** Announce trips after you return, not before. Broadcasting "I'm away for 2 weeks!" tells burglars your home is empty.
* **Your child's or grandchild's school name or schedule:** This could help predators locate them.
* **Financial information:** Never post about money, bank accounts, or bills.

## Step 4: Spot and Avoid Scams

Scammers use social media to trick people into giving away money or personal information. Here's how to recognize them.

## Common Social Media Scams

**The "I'm Stuck Abroad" Scam:**

* **What happens:** You get a message from a "friend" saying they're stranded in another country and need money wired urgently.
* **The truth:** Their account was hacked. Real friends would call, not just message.
* **What to do:** Call your friend directly using a phone number you already have (not one from the message).

**The "You Won a Prize" Scam:**

* **What happens:** A message claims you won a lottery, gift card, or prize, but you need to pay a "processing fee" or provide bank details.
* **The truth:** Real prizes never ask you to pay first.
* **What to do:** Delete the message. If it seems like it might be real, research the company independently (don't click links in the message).

**The Fake Friend Request:**

* **What happens:** You get a friend request from someone who's already your friend.
* **The truth:** Scammers clone profiles to trick your real friends into accepting them.
* **What to do:** Check if you're already friends with that person. If so, ignore the new request and tell your friend their account may be compromised.

**The Romance Scam:**

* **What happens:** A stranger befriends you, quickly declares romantic interest, then asks for money due to an "emergency".
* **The truth:** They're professional scammers targeting lonely people.
* **What to do:** Never send money to someone you've only met online. End contact immediately.

## Red Flags to Watch For

* **Urgency:** "Act now!" or "Send money immediately!" are pressure tactics.
* **Grammar mistakes:** Many scams come from overseas and have spelling/grammar errors.
* **Requests for money or gift cards:** Real companies and friends don't ask for payment via social media messages.
* **Too good to be true:** Free iPhones, miracle weight loss, "get rich quick" schemes—all scams.

## Step 5: Manage What Others See About You

Even if you don't post something, others might tag you in photos or posts. Here's how to control that.

## Review Tags Before They Appear (Facebook)

1. Go to **Settings** > **Profile and Tagging**.
2. Turn on **Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your profile**.
3. From now on, you'll get a notification to approve or remove tags.

## Remove Unwanted Photos or Tags

**On Facebook:**

1. Go to your profile and click **Photos**.
2. Click **Photos of You**.
3. Find the photo you want to remove.
4. Click the three dots (...) and select **Remove tag**.

**On Instagram:**

1. Go to your profile and tap the person icon (tagged photos).
2. Tap the photo you want to remove.
3. Tap your username on the photo.
4. Tap **Remove Me From Post**.

## Step 6: Recognize Fake News and Misinformation

Social media spreads information fast—both true and false. Here's how to tell the difference.

## Before Sharing, Ask Yourself

* **Is the source credible?** Check if it's from a known news organization, not "TotallyRealNews.com".
* **Does it cite sources?** Real news articles reference where information comes from.
* **Is it designed to make you angry or scared?** Fake news uses extreme emotions to get shares.
* **Can you find it elsewhere?** Search Google for the headline. If only one site reports it, it's probably false.

## Fact-Checking Websites

Visit these to verify suspicious claims:

* **Snopes.com** – Checks urban legends and viral stories
* **FactCheck.org** – Verifies political claims
* **PolitiFact.com** – Rates the accuracy of statements

## Step 7: Protect Yourself from Identity Theft

Identity theft happens when someone uses your personal information to open accounts or make purchases in your name.

## Prevention Steps

1. **Don't overshare personal details:** Avoid posting about your maiden name, pet's name, or first car (common security questions).
2. **Be cautious with quizzes and games:** "What's your superhero name? Use your mother's maiden name + your street!" These are data collection schemes.
3. **Check your privacy settings quarterly:** Social media platforms change their policies, so review settings every few months.
4. **Google yourself:** Search your name to see what information about you is publicly available.

## What to Do If You're Hacked

1. **Change your password immediately** on that account and any other accounts using the same password.
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** if it wasn't already on.
3. **Notify your friends:** Post (from a different account or ask a friend to post) that your account was compromised and they should ignore messages from you.
4. **Report it to the platform:** Use Facebook's "Hacked Accounts" help center or Instagram's support.
5. **Check your bank accounts:** Make sure no unauthorized purchases were made.

## Step 8: Keep Children and Grandchildren Safe

If kids or grandkids use your devices, teach them these rules:

* **Never share personal information:** Not even with "friends" they've only met online.
* **Tell an adult about uncomfortable messages:** No secrets when it comes to online safety.
* **Don't click links from strangers:** These could contain viruses or lead to dangerous websites.
* **Use kid-friendly platforms:** YouTube Kids, Messenger Kids (Facebook's version for children under 13).

## Parental Controls

Most devices have built-in parental controls:

* **iPhone/iPad:** Settings > Screen Time > Content & Privacy Restrictions
* **Android:** Settings > Digital Wellbeing & Parental Controls
* **Computers:** Windows Family Safety or Mac Screen Time

## Common Questions

**Q: I accidentally accepted a friend request from a stranger. What should I do?**  
A: Go to their profile, click **Friends** (or the checkmark), and select **Unfriend**. Then go to **Settings** > **Blocking** and add them to your blocked list so they can't contact you again.

**Q: Someone is pretending to be me on social media. How do I stop them?**  
A: Report the fake account to the platform immediately. On Facebook, go to the fake profile, click the three dots (...), and select **Find support or report profile** > **Pretending to be someone**. Warn your friends not to accept requests from this impostor.

**Q: How do I know if a message is really from Facebook or Instagram?**  
A: Real messages from these companies will appear in your **Settings** > **Security** section, not as direct messages. If you receive a message claiming to be from the company asking for your password or payment, it's a scam. Never click links in these messages.

**Q: Can I be completely anonymous on social media?**  
A: It's very difficult. Even with privacy settings, platforms collect data about you. If anonymity is important, consider not using social media or using a pseudonym (but read the platform's terms of service—some require real names).

**Q: I saw a suspicious post from my friend. Should I tell them?**  
A: Yes! Contact them outside of social media (call or text) to let them know. Their account might be hacked, or they might not realize they're sharing something dangerous.

**Q: Is it safe to use public WiFi to check social media?**  
A: Public WiFi (at coffee shops, airports, etc.) is less secure. Hackers can intercept your data. If you must use public WiFi, avoid logging into sensitive accounts like banking or social media. Consider using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) app for extra protection.

**Q: What's the difference between "Friends" and "Public" on Facebook?**  
A: **Friends** means only people you've accepted as friends can see that post. **Public** means anyone on the internet—even people without Facebook accounts—can see it. Always choose Friends for personal content.

**Q: Can I trust ads on social media?**  
A: Be cautious. Many ads are legitimate, but some are scams. Never click ads promising miracle cures, extreme discounts, or asking for immediate payment. If interested, search for the company independently instead of clicking the ad.

**Q: How often should I change my passwords?**  
A: Every 3-6 months for important accounts (email, banking, social media). If a company announces a data breach, change that password immediately.
