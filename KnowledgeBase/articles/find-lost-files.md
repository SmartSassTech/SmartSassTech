If you can't find a file, don't panic. It is likely just in a different folder than you expected.

## 1. The Fastest Way: Search

Don't click through folders manually. Use the search tool.

## Windows

1. Press the **Windows Key** on your keyboard.
2. Start typing the file name immediately.
3. Look at the list of results.

## Mac

1. Press **Command (⌘) + Spacebar**. (This opens Spotlight Search).
2. Type the file name.
3. Click the file to open it.

## 2. Check "Downloads" and "Trash"

* **Downloads Folder**: Most files from the internet go here automatically. Open your file manager and look for "Downloads" on the left sidebar.
* **Recycle Bin / Trash**: Did you accidentally delete it? Check the bin icon on your desktop. If you find it, right-click and select **Restore** (Windows) or **Put Back** (Mac).

* [OneDrive](https://onedrive.live.com)
* [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com)
* [iCloud Drive](https://www.icloud.com/iclouddrive)
