title: Understanding Privacy Settings on Your Phone
---

Take control of what apps can see and access on your device.

## Why Privacy Settings Matter

Every app you install wants access to something—your camera, location, contacts, or photos. Some apps need these permissions to work properly. Others don't, but ask anyway to collect data about you.

**The goal:** Give apps only what they truly need, and nothing more.

## For iPhone Users (iOS)

## Check App Permissions

1. Open **Settings**
2. Scroll down and tap **Privacy & Security**
3. You'll see categories like Location Services, Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Photos

**What to do:** Tap each category to see which apps have access. Turn off any apps that don't need that permission.

* **Example:** Does a flashlight app really need access to your contacts? Probably not.

## Control Location Tracking

Location is one of the most sensitive permissions.

1. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services**
2. Tap any app to see its location access
3. Choose:
   * **Never** — App can't see your location
   * **Ask Next Time** — You decide each time
   * **While Using the App** — Only when you're actively using it (best for most apps)
   * **Always** — Even when the app is closed (only for apps you really trust)

**Pro tip:** Most apps work fine with "While Using the App."

## Review Photo Access

Apps don't need access to your entire photo library anymore.

1. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Photos**
2. For each app, choose:
   * **None** — No access
   * **Selected Photos** — You pick which photos the app can see (recommended)
   * **Full Access** — Everything

## Limit Ad Tracking

1. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking**
2. Turn off **Allow Apps to Request to Track**
3. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising**
4. Turn off **Personalized Ads**

**Why it works:** Limits how companies track you across different apps and websites.

## Check Activity Report

See what apps are doing behind your back.

1. Go to **Settings > Privacy & Security > App Privacy Report**
2. Turn it on and wait a few days
3. Come back to see which apps accessed your data, when, and how often

## For Android Users

## Check Permissions

1. Open **Settings**
2. Tap **Security & Privacy** (or just **Privacy**)
3. Tap **Permission Manager**
4. Browse categories: Location, Camera, Microphone, Contacts, Storage

**What to do:** Tap each category to review which apps have access. Remove permissions for apps that don't need them.

## Control Location Settings

1. Go to **Settings > Location**
2. Make sure location is on (you control it per-app)
3. Tap **App Location Permissions**
4. For each app, choose:
   * **Don't allow**
   * **Allow only while using the app** (best option)
   * **Ask every time**
   * **Allow all the time** (only for trusted apps like maps)

## Manage Photo and File Access

1. Go to **Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Permission Manager**
2. Tap **Files and Media** or **Photos and Videos**
3. Review which apps can access your files

**Android 13+:** You can choose to give apps access to selected photos only, not your entire library.

## Limit Ad Personalization

1. Go to **Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Ads**
2. Turn on **Delete advertising ID**

**Additional step:**

1. Open the **Google** app
2. Tap your profile picture > **Manage your Google Account**
3. Go to **Data & Privacy**
4. Under "Ad settings," turn off **Ad Personalization**

## Review App Activity

1. Go to **Settings > Security & Privacy > Privacy Dashboard**
2. See which apps accessed your location, camera, microphone, and more in the last 24 hours

## Privacy Settings for Both iPhone and Android

## Turn Off Unnecessary Notifications

Apps use notifications to bring you back, even when you don't need them.

* **iPhone:** Settings > Notifications > [Select App] > Turn off
* **Android:** Settings > Notifications > App Settings > [Select App] > Turn off

## Review Connected Accounts

Apps often ask to "Sign in with Google" or "Sign in with Apple." Review what's connected.

* **iPhone:** Settings > [Your Name] > Sign in with Apple
* **Android:** Settings > Google > Manage your Google Account > Security > Third-party apps with account access

**What to do:** Remove any apps you no longer use.

## Use App Lock or Screen Time Limits

Protect sensitive apps with extra security.

* **iPhone:** Settings > Screen Time > App Limits (or use Face ID for specific apps)
* **Android:** Settings > Security & Privacy > App Lock (varies by manufacturer)

## Quick Privacy Checklist

* **Do** review app permissions at least once every few months
* **Do** delete apps you no longer use
* **Do** use "While Using the App" for location whenever possible
* **Don't** grant permissions just because an app asks—think about whether it really needs it
* **Don't** allow access to all your photos—use "Selected Photos" instead
* **Do** turn off ad tracking to limit data collection

## Red Flags: When to Deny Permission

* A calculator app asking for your location
* A wallpaper app requesting microphone access
* A game wanting access to your contacts
* Any app asking for more than it logically needs to function

**Rule of thumb:** If it doesn't make sense, say no.

## If an App Won't Work Without Permission

Some apps legitimately need certain permissions (e.g., a camera app needs camera access). But if an app refuses to work unless you grant unnecessary permissions, consider:

1. **Finding an alternative app** that respects your privacy
2. **Contacting the developer** to ask why the permission is required
3. **Uninstalling the app** if it feels intrusive
