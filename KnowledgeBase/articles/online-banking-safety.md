title: How to Bank Online Safely
---

Manage your money online without visiting a branch.

## 1. Safety First

* **Use the Official App:** The safest way to bank is the official app from the App Store/Play Store.
* **Type Addresses Directly:** Never click links in emails or texts claiming to be your bank. Type `chase.com` or `wellsfargo.com` manually.
* **Avoid Public Wi-Fi:** Turn off Wi-Fi and use your phone's cellular data when banking in public.

## 2. Setting Up Online Banking

1. Go to your bank's official website.
2. Look for a button saying **Enroll**, **Sign Up**, or **Register**.
3. You will typically need your account number and Social Security number.
4. **Critical Step:** Enable **Two-Factor Authentication** so a code is required to log in.

## 3. Key Features

* **Bill Pay:** Add a company (like your electric utility) and pay them directly from the site. No more paper checks.
* **Mobile Deposit:** Use the specific "Deposit" feature in the app to take a photo of a check and deposit it instantly.
* **Alerts:** Go to settings and set up text alerts for any transaction >$100.

## 4. Scam Awareness

* **Fake Fraud Alerts:** If you get a text saying "Fraud Detected, click here," **do not click**. Call the number on the **back of your debit card** to verify.
* **P2P Scams (Zelle/Venmo):** Only use Zelle to send money to friends and family. Treat it like cash—once sent, it is gone.
