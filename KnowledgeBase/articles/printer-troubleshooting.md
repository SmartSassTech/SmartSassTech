Fix connection issues, papers jams, and poor print quality quickly.

## 1. Quick Checks

* **Is it On?** Check the power cable and make sure the printer is turned on.
* **Is it Connected?** Ensure the USB cable is tight or the Wi-Fi is connected.
* **Is there Paper/Ink?** Refill the paper tray and check ink levels on the printer screen.

## 2. The "Restart Everything" Fix

This resolves 90% of printer issues.

1. Turn off the printer and **unplug it** from the wall.
2. **Restart** your computer.
3. **Restart** your Wi-Fi router (if using a wireless printer).
4. Plug the printer back in, turn it on, and try printing again.

## 3. Fixing Paper Jams

1. Turn off the printer.
2. Open the access panels (check front, back, and top).
3. Gently pull the paper out **in the direction it normally moves**.
4. Remove any small torn pieces.

## 4. Reinstall Drivers

If the printer is on but the computer can't "see" it, you likely need a new driver.

1. Go to your manufacturer's website (links below).
2. Search for your specific model number.
3. Download and install the driver/software package.
