title: How to Manage Your Passwords with a Password Manager
---

A password manager safely stores all your passwords in one place, automatically fills them in, and generates strong ones for you. You only need to remember one master password.

## 1. Select Your Device to Get Started

Most devices come with a free, secure password manager built-in. Setup typically takes less than 2 minutes.

## Built-in Password Managers (Free & Recommended)

* **iPhone / iPad**: Uses **iCloud Keychain**.
  * [Apple Support: Set up iCloud Keychain](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204085)
* **Android**: Uses **Google Password Manager**.
  * [Google Help: Manage saved passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6208650)
* **Mac**: Uses **iCloud Keychain** (syncs with iPhone).
  * [Apple Support: Set up iCloud Keychain on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/set-up-icloud-keychain-mchle6d0f7/mac)
* **Windows**: Uses your browser (Edge or Chrome).
  * [Microsoft Edge: Save or forget passwords](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/save-or-forget-passwords-in-microsoft-edge-b4beecb0-f2a8-1ca0-f26f-9ec247a30a88)
  * [Google Chrome: Manage passwords](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95606)

## Standalone Apps (Cross-Platform)

If you switch between Apple and Android/Windows frequently, consider a standalone app like [1Password](https://1password.com/), [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/), or [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/).

## 2. Universal Basics: How They Work

Regardless of which app you choose, they all work essentially the same way:

1. **Saving Passwords**: When you log in to a site, the manager will prompt you to **"Save Password"**. Always say yes.
2. **Auto-Filling**: When you return to that site, look for a **Key Icon** or your username in the login box. Tap it to fill your credentials instantly.
3. **Generating Passwords**: When creating a new account, the manager will suggest a strong, random password (e.g., `Xy9#mP2$L`). Use it—the manager will remember it for you.

---

## 3. Maintenance & Troubleshooting

* **View Saved Passwords**: Search for "Passwords" in your device's global **Settings** menu.
* **Not Auto-Filling?** Ensure you aren't in "Private" or "Incognito" mode.
* **Security Checkup**: Use your manager’s "Security" dashboard to find and replace weak or reused passwords.

> **Tip**: Never lose your master password (or device passcode). It is the key to your vault, and often cannot be recovered by support teams.
