title: Setting Up and Checking Your Smartphone Voicemail
---

A quick guide to using voicemail on your smartphone.

## 1. Setting Up for the First Time

* **iPhone:** Open the **Phone** app, tap **Voicemail**, then tap **Set Up Now**. You will be asked to create a 4-6 digit password and record a greeting.
* **Android:** Open the **Phone** app and press and hold the **1** key. Follow the automated voice prompts to create a password and record your greeting.

## 2. Checking Messages

* **Visual Voicemail (Easiest):** Open the **Phone** app and look for the **Voicemail** tab (usually bottom right). Tap any message in the list to listen to it.
* **Calling In (Old School):** Press and hold **1** on your keypad. You will hear a menu allowing you to listen to messages, delete them, or change your greeting.

## 3. Resetting Your Password

If you forget your voicemail PIN, you usually cannot see it on the phone. You must reset it.

* **iPhone:** Go to **Settings > Phone > Change Voicemail Password**.
* **Carrier Method:** Log in to your Verizon, AT&T, or T-Mobile account online (or call 611) to reset the PIN.

## Troubleshooting

* **Mailbox Full:** If callers can't leave messages, your inbox is full. Call your voicemail (hold 1) and delete old saved messages.
* **No Notifications:** Go to **Settings > Notifications > Phone** and make sure **Badges** (red dot) are turned on.
