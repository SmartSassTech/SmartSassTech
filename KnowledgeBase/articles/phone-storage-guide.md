title: How to Clear Storage Space on Your Phone
---

If your phone is full and slow, follow these steps to reclaim space quickly.

## 1. Check What's Using Space

* **iPhone:** Go to **Settings > General > iPhone Storage**. You'll see a color-coded bar showing what's taking up space.
* **Android:** Go to **Settings > Storage** (or "Battery and Device Care").

## 2. Eliminate the Biggest Culprits (Photos & Videos)

Photos and videos typically take up 50% or more of your space.

* **Delete Videos First:** Videos take up much more space than photos. Deleting just 5 minutes of 4K video can save as much space as deleting 500 photos.
* **Use Cloud Optimization:**
  * **iPhone:** Go to **Settings > [Your Name] > iCloud > Photos** and select **Optimize iPhone Storage**. This keeps full-quality photos in the cloud and smaller versions on your phone.
  * **Android:** Open **Google Photos**, tap your profile, tap **Photos Settings**, then tap **Free up device storage**. This removes photos from your phone that are safely backed up to Google.

## 3. Remove Unused Apps

* Go to your storage settings (from Step 1) and scroll down to see the list of apps.
* Delete any app you haven't used in **6 months**.
* **Games** are often 1GB+ each—deleting one big game can save a lot of space.

## 4. Clear Old Messages

* Text message threads with lots of photos and videos can be huge.
* **Auto-Delete (iPhone):** Go to **Settings > Messages > Keep Messages** and set it to **1 Year** or **30 Days**.
* **Manual Delete:** Delete old group chats where people shared many photos.

## 5. Clear "Other" or "System" Data

* **Restart Your Phone:** A simple restart clears temporary cache files that can clog up your system.
* **Clear Browser Cache:** In your Safari or Chrome settings, find the option to "Clear History and Website Data."
