## 1. Check for Built-in Bluetooth

Most modern Smart TVs (Samsung, LG, Sony, Vizio) have Bluetooth built-in.

## General Connection Steps

1. Put your headphones/speaker into **Pairing Mode** (usually by holding the power or Bluetooth button until it flashes).
2. On your TV, go to **Settings** > **Sound** (or **Remotes & Accessories**).
3. Select **Bluetooth Speaker List** or **Pair New Device**.
4. Select your device from the list to connect.

## Official Setup Guides by Brand

If you can't find the setting, check your manufacturer's guide:

* [LG TV: Wireless Sound Setup](https://www.lg.com/us/support/help-library/lg-tv-how-to-connect-a-bluetooth-device--20153130768679)
* [Sony TV: Bluetooth Instructions](https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00159290)

> **Tip:** If you experience audio delay (lip-sync issues), look for an "Audio Sync" or "Delay" setting in your TV's sound menu.

## 2. Using Streaming Devices (Roku / Fire TV / Apple TV)

If your TV doesn't have Bluetooth, your streaming player might.

* **Roku**:
  * **Method 1**: Use the **Roku Mobile App** on your phone (Feature: "Private Listening"). Connect headphones to your phone, and the TV audio will stream through them.
  * **Method 2**: Roku Ultra and Soundbars support direct Bluetooth pairing in **Settings** > **Remotes & devices**.
  * [Roku Support: How to use Private Listening](https://support.roku.com/article/217478308)
* **Fire TV**:
  * Go to **Settings** > **Controllers & Bluetooth Devices** > **Other Bluetooth Devices**.
  * [Amazon Help: Connect Bluetooth Headphones](https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=G54483L5J5S44K2A)

## 3. What if My TV Has No Bluetooth?

You have two simple options:

1. **Bluetooth Transmitter ($20-$40)**: A small adapter that plugs into your TV's headphone jack or optical port and transmits audio to your headphones. (Popular brands: Avantree, 1Mii).
2. **Streaming Device**: Buy a Roku or Fire TV Stick (cheaper than a new TV) and use their Bluetooth features mentioned above.

## Troubleshooting

* **Can't Pair?** Turn the device off and on. Ensure it is not connected to your phone.
* **No Sound?** Check that your TV's "Sound Output" is set to "Bluetooth" or "Optical" (if using a transmitter).
* **Too Quiet?** You may need to turn up the volume on **BOTH** the TV and headphones.
