title: How to Use an Internet Browser
---

An internet browser (like Chrome or Safari) is the program you use to visit websites. Here is a guide to the basics.

---

## 1. Browser vs. Search Engine

People often confuse these two:

* **Browser**: The tool on your computer (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Edge). It's like the car you drive.
* **Search Engine**: A website that helps you find things (e.g., Google, Bing). It's like the map you read.

## 2. Key Features

Almost all browsers look and work the same way:

* **Address Bar** (Top): Type a website name (like `amazon.com`) or a search question (like "weather today") here.
* **Tabs** (Top Edge): Allow you to have multiple pages open at once. Click the `+` to open a new one.
* **Back Button** (<- Arrow): Takes you to the previous page you were on.
* **Refresh** (Circular Arrow): Reloads the page if it's stuck or outdated.
* **Bookmarks** (Star Icon): Saves the current page so you can find it easily later.

> **Tip**: Look for the **Menu** (three dots or lines in the top corner) to find History, Settings, and Print options.

## 3. Staying Safe Online

* **Look for the Padlock**: Secure sites (like banks) show a padlock 🔒 icon next to the address.
* **Beware of Pop-ups**: If a window pops up saying "You won!" or "Virus Detected!", close it immediately. It is a scam.
* **Check the Address**: Scammers use fake names like `amaz0n.com` (with a zero). Double-check the spelling before entering credit card info.

## Common Questions

## What is Private/Incognito Mode?

It opens a window that doesn't save your history or cookies. Use it for shopping for gifts or on public computers. It **does not** hide your activity from your internet provider.

## Why is my browser slow?

You might have too many tabs open (try closing some) or too many "extensions" installed. Clearing your "Cache and Cookies" in settings can also help.
