title: How to Organize and Back Up Your Digital Photos
---

Keep your digital memories safe and easy to find with these organization and backup strategies.

## Basic Organization

## Albums vs. Library

* **Library:** Contains *all* your photos sorted by date. Use this to scroll through everything.
* **Albums:** Custom collections (e.g., "Vacation 2024", "Grandkids") that you create. A photo can be in multiple albums without duplicating the actual file, saving space.

## Smarter Searching

Modern photo apps are intelligent. Instead of scrolling endlessly, tap the **Search** icon and type:

* **Dates:** "July 2023", "Christmas"
* **Places:** "Paris", "Florida", "Beach"
* **Objects:** "Dog", "Car", "Sunset", "Flower"
* **People:** Names (once you've labeled faces in the "People" album)

## Tips for Decluttering

* **The "6-Month Rule":** If you haven't looked at a photo in 6 months and it's not a sentimental favorite, consider deleting it.
* **Delete Duplicates:**
  * **iPhone:** Open Photos > Albums > **Duplicates** (under Utilities) to merge copies. [Learn how](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213456).
  * **Google Photos:** Use the "Free up space" tool to remove photos that are already backed up.
* **Share Albums:** Instead of texting photos individually, create a **Shared Album**. Friends and family can view them instantly and even add their own pictures.
