## Common Questions

## What's the difference between iMessage and SMS?

iMessage (blue bubbles) works between Apple devices over internet—free, can send large files, read receipts, typing indicators. SMS (green bubbles) is standard text messaging—works with any phone, may count against carrier plan, limited features.

## How do I back up my iPhone?

Two ways: iCloud (automatic over Wi-Fi when charging) or computer (iTunes/Finder). Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → iCloud Backup → turn on. First backup takes a while. Subsequent backups are incremental (faster).

## What's an Apple ID?

Your account for everything Apple—App Store, iCloud, iMessage, FaceTime. Same ID across all Apple devices syncs everything. Free to create. Use email address and password.

## How much storage do I need?

Depends on usage. 64GB: light users, mostly streaming. 128GB: most people, moderate photos/apps. 256GB+: lots of photos/videos/games. Can't expand later, so consider future needs. Use iCloud to supplement.

## Can I use Android chargers?

Newer iPhones (15 and later): USB-C, works with most USB-C chargers. Older iPhones: Lightning cable, works with any USB power adapter but need Lightning cable specifically. Fast charging needs 20W+ adapter.

## Why is my iPhone hot?

Normal during: charging, initial setup, restoring backup, updating, intensive apps/games. Concerning if: hot during normal use, draining battery fast, slowing down. Try: close apps, avoid direct sunlight, remove case while charging, restart phone.

## What's Optimized Battery Charging?

Learns your charging routine, waits to charge past 80% until you need it. Reduces battery aging. Charges to 100% when you typically unplug. Settings → Battery → Battery Health & Charging. Keep enabled for longer battery life.

## How do I take a screenshot?

* **Face ID models:** Press side button + volume up simultaneously
* **Home button models:** Press home + side button simultaneously
* Screenshot appears bottom-left, tap to edit/share
* Automatically saves to Photos

## Can I use wired headphones?

Newer iPhones: No headphone jack, need Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter (sold separately) or USB-C headphones (iPhone 15+). Or use wireless headphones/AirPods. Adapter cheap if needed.

## What's Airdrop?

Share files/photos wirelessly between nearby Apple devices. Control Center → Airdrop → choose Contacts Only or Everyone for 10 Minutes. Select item → Share → AirDrop → choose recipient. Fast, no internet needed.

## Do I need antivirus?

No, iPhone very secure. Can't download apps outside App Store (where Apple vets everything). Basic precautions: don't click suspicious links, keep iOS updated, use strong passcode, enable Find My.

## What's Face ID actually seeing?

3D depth map of face using infrared—not storing photos. Secure, stays on device, never sent to Apple. Works in dark. Can't be fooled by photos or masks. More secure than passcode alone.
