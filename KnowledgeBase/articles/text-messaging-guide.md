A quick guide to messaging on iPhone and Android.

## 1. Sending a Text

1. Open the **Messages** app (Green icon on iPhone, Blue icon on Android).
2. Tap the **New Message** icon (usually a Pencil or + symbol).
3. Type the person's name (if in contacts) or phone number in the "To:" field.
4. Type your message at the bottom and tap the **Arrow/Paper Airplane** to send.

## 2. Sending Photos

1. Inside a conversation, tap the **Camera** icon (to take a photo) or the **Photos** icon (to select one from your gallery).
2. Select the photo(s) you want to share.
3. Tap the **Send** arrow.

## 3. Group Messages

* **To create:** Start a new message and add multiple people to the "To:" field.
* **To leave (iPhone):** Tap the group icons at the top > Info (i) > **Leave this Conversation**. *Note: This only works if everyone in the group is using an iPhone (blue bubbles).*
* **To leave (Android):** Tap the three dots menu > Group Details > **Leave group**.

## Common Questions

## Blue vs. Green Bubbles (iPhone)

* **Blue:** iMessage (Free over Wi-Fi, sent to another Apple device).
* **Green:** SMS (Regular text, sent to Android or non-Apple phones).
* *Both work fine! Green just means it's a standard text.*

## "Not Delivered" Error

* Check your signal bars. If you have "No Service," texts cannot send.
* Tap the red exclamation mark to try sending again as a text message.

## Blurry Photos?

* Sending photos between iPhone and Android (Green bubbles) often lowers quality. For high-quality sharing, use **WhatsApp** or **Email**.
