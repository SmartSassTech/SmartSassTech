Facebook is a social network for connecting with friends and family, sharing updates, and discovering content. This guide covers the basics and how to fix common problems.

---

## 1. Getting Started

* **Sign Up:** Go to [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com) → Create New Account.
* **What You Need:** Real name, email or phone number, password, birthday, gender.
* **Verify Account:** Confirm email or phone number with code Facebook sends.
* **Profile Photo:** Add a picture of yourself (helps friends find you).
* **Find Friends:** Facebook suggests people you might know based on contacts, email, and mutual friends.

* Stays friends but don't see their posts
* They won't be notified

**Favorites:**

* Choose up to 30 friends/pages to prioritize
* See their posts first
* News Feed → Settings (gear icon) → Favorites

**Chronological feed:**

## Common Questions

## Is Facebook free?

Yes, completely free to use. Facebook makes money from advertisements. You'll never be charged to use basic features. Some games and apps may have in-app purchases.

## What's the difference between Friends and Followers?

Friends: Mutual connection—both must accept. See each other's friends-only posts. Followers: One-way connection—they see your public posts without being friends. Public figures often have followers instead of friends.

## How do I delete my account?

Settings & Privacy → Settings → Your Facebook Information → Deactivation and Deletion → Permanently Delete Account. Account deleted after 30-day grace period. Or deactivate temporarily (can reactivate anytime). Deleting is permanent—all data lost.

## Can I have more than one Facebook account?

Officially no—Facebook Terms of Service allow only one personal account per person. Can have personal profile plus Pages for business/public presence. Multiple accounts may be disabled if discovered.

## Who can see my posts?

Depends on privacy setting chosen when posting. Public: Anyone on or off Facebook. Friends: Only your friends. Friends except: Friends minus specific people you choose. Specific friends: Only people you select. Only me: Just you (like a private diary).

## What are tags and how do they work?

Tagging links people to posts. Type @ followed by their name to tag. They're notified and post may appear on their timeline (if they approve). Can tag in posts, comments, and photos. Can remove yourself from tags: Timeline and Tagging settings.

## What's the difference between blocking and unfriending?

Unfriend: Removes friend connection but can still see each other's public posts and send friend request again. Block: Completely prevents interaction—can't see profile, posts, or contact each other. Blocking more severe and private (they won't be notified but may notice).

## Can people see when I view their profile?

No, Facebook doesn't notify people when you view their profile. Third-party apps claiming to show this are scams. Looking at someone's profile is completely private.

## What are memories?

On This Day feature shows posts from past years. Appears at top of News Feed. Can edit what appears: Turn off specific dates, periods, or people. Settings: Memories → Preferences. Nostalgic way to relive old moments.

## How do I stop getting spam?

Mark as spam: Three dots on post/message → Mark as Spam. Unfriend/unfollow suspicious accounts. Adjust who can send friend requests. Don't click suspicious links. Enable two-factor authentication. Report fake accounts. Be cautious accepting requests from strangers.

## What's Meta?

Facebook's parent company (rebranded in 2021). Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and other apps. "Facebook" still refers to the social network specifically.

## Can I use Facebook without the app?

Yes, use web browser (mobile or desktop). Visit facebook.com or m.facebook.com. Full features available. App offers notifications and faster performance but not required.

Think before you post—once online, it's hard to completely erase. It's okay to take breaks or limit your time. Focus on genuine connections rather than likes and reactions. Most importantly: Have fun, stay safe, and use Facebook in ways that enrich your life rather than stress you out. Happy connecting!
