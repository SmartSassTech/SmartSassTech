Protect your money and personal information while getting the best deals on the internet.

## 1. Shop Only on Secure Websites

Before entering any payment information, make sure the website is legitimate and secure.

## Check for HTTPS

* Look at the website address—it should start with **https://** (the "s" means secure)
* Look for a **padlock icon** in the address bar
* **Why it matters:** HTTPS encrypts your data so hackers can't intercept your credit card number

**Red flag:** If a checkout page shows "Not Secure" or uses http:// (no "s"), don't enter payment info.

## Verify the Website Is Real

Scammers create fake websites that look like real stores.

* **Check the URL carefully:** Is it `amazon.com` or `amazan.com`? (One letter off = fake)
* **Look for contact information:** Legitimate stores have phone numbers, addresses, and support pages
* **Check for reviews:** Search "[website name] reviews" or "[website name] scam" to see what others say
* **Trust your gut:** If a website looks unprofessional or has tons of typos, it's probably fake

## 2. Use the Right Payment Methods

Some payment methods offer better protection than others.

## Best Options (Most Secure)

* **Credit cards:** Offer fraud protection—if someone steals your number, you're not liable for charges
* **PayPal:** Acts as a middleman—the seller never sees your card number
* **Apple Pay / Google Pay:** Generate one-time card numbers for each purchase
* **Virtual credit cards:** Many banks offer temporary card numbers for online shopping

## Use With Caution

* **Debit cards:** Money comes directly from your bank account—harder to get back if stolen
* **Wire transfers:** Zero fraud protection—once sent, it's gone forever
* **Cryptocurrency:** No buyer protection—avoid unless you completely trust the seller
* **Gift cards:** Never pay with gift cards unless buying from the actual store (iTunes cards for Apple, etc.)

**Golden rule:** If someone asks you to pay with gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency for regular shopping, it's 100% a scam.

## 3. Watch Out for Deal Scams

If a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is.

## Common Scam Tactics

* **Unbelievable prices:** Brand new iPhone for $200? Not real.
* **Fake urgency:** "Only 2 left! Buy now or miss out!" — pressure tactics
* **Suspicious ads:** Ads on social media for unknown stores with amazing deals
* **Copycat brands:** Websites selling "Nkie" shoes or "Adidos" clothing

## How to Verify Deals

* **Compare prices:** Check the same product on Amazon, eBay, or the manufacturer's website
* **Research the seller:** Look for reviews outside their own website
* **Use trusted retailers:** Stick with well-known stores when possible

## 4. Protect Your Personal Information

Give only what's necessary—nothing more.

## What Legitimate Stores Need

* Name
* Shipping address
* Email address
* Payment information

## What They DON'T Need

* Social Security number (except for credit checks on big purchases)
* Driver's license number
* Bank account login credentials
* More information than necessary

**Red flag:** If a store asks for your SSN to buy a T-shirt, close the browser and walk away.

## 5. Shop Smart on Social Media

Social media ads can lead to both great finds and total scams.

## Before Buying from Social Media Ads

* **Click through to the actual website** and evaluate it
* **Search for the company name + "scam" or "reviews"**
* **Check how long they've been in business** (new sites can be risky)
* **Look at their social media presence:** Real companies have active, established accounts
* **Be skeptical of ads with stock photos** or stolen images

**Common scam:** Ads showing incredible products that turn out to be cheap knockoffs or never arrive at all.

## 6. Use Strong Passwords and 2FA

Your shopping accounts contain payment information and order history.

* **Use unique passwords** for each shopping site (see our password guide)
* **Enable two-factor authentication** on major retailers like Amazon, eBay, Target
* **Don't save payment info** on sites you rarely use

**Why it matters:** If a hacker gets into your account, they can make purchases with your saved payment methods.

## 7. Review Your Statements Regularly

Catch fraudulent charges early.

* **Check your credit card statements** at least weekly when shopping online frequently
* **Set up transaction alerts** through your bank—get texted when charges occur
* **Report unauthorized charges immediately** (the sooner you report, the better)

**Know your rights:** Under federal law, your maximum liability for unauthorized credit card charges is $50 (most banks make it $0).

## 8. Be Careful with Public Wi-Fi

Don't shop on public networks at coffee shops, airports, or hotels.

* **Wait until you're home** on your secure network
* **Use your phone's data** instead of public Wi-Fi if you must shop
* **Use a VPN** if you regularly need to shop on public Wi-Fi

**Why it matters:** Hackers on public Wi-Fi can intercept your data, including passwords and payment info.

## 9. Save Your Receipts and Documentation

Keep records of your online purchases.

* **Take screenshots** of order confirmations
* **Save confirmation emails** in a folder
* **Track your packages** using the provided tracking numbers
* **Keep return policies handy** in case you need to return items

**Why it matters:** If something goes wrong (wrong item, never arrives, unauthorized charge), you'll have proof of purchase.

## 10. Know Your Consumer Rights

You have protections when shopping online.

## Credit Card Chargebacks

If a seller doesn't deliver or sends the wrong item and won't help, you can dispute the charge with your credit card company.

* **Call your card issuer** and explain the situation
* **Provide documentation** (order confirmations, emails, photos)
* **File within 60 days** of the charge appearing on your statement

## Return Policies

* **Read the return policy** before buying (especially for electronics, clothing)
* **Know the deadline:** Many stores offer 30-90 day returns
* **Keep packaging:** Some stores won't accept returns without original boxes

## Report Scams

* **File a complaint** with the FTC at [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)
* **Report to your state attorney general**
* **Leave reviews** to warn others
