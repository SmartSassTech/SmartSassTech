title: How to Connect Hearing Aids to Your TV, Phone, and Devices
---

Modern hearing aids can stream audio directly from your devices. Because every hearing aid brand works differently, the best instructions come from the specific manufacturer.

## 1. Connecting to Phones (iPhone & Android)

## iPhone (Made for iPhone)

Most modern hearing aids connect directly to iPhone without an app.

* [Control hearing devices on iPhone](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/hearing-devices-iph5c46b54ca/ios)

## Android (ASHA)

Newer Android phones (Android 10+) support direct streaming with compatible hearing aids.

## 3. Connecting to TV

Direct Bluetooth connection to TV often has a delay (lip-sync issues). We **strongly recommend** using the TV Streamer accessory made by your hearing aid manufacturer.

* **ReSound**: [TV Streamer 2](https://www.resound.com/en-us/hearing-aids/accessories/tv-streamer-2)
* **Oticon**: [TV Adapter](https://www.oticon.com/hearing-aid-users/support/accessories/tv-adapter)

## 4. Quick Troubleshooting

* **Audio only in one ear?** Put both hearing aids back in the charger for 10 seconds, then take them out to reset.
* **Not connecting?** Turn Bluetooth OFF and ON again on your phone.
