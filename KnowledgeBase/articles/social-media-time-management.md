title: Manage Your Social Media Time and Set Daily Limits
---

Social media helps you stay connected with family and friends, but it's easy to spend more time scrolling than you intended. This guide will help you take control of your social media use so it fits into your life in a healthy way.

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 20 minutes to read and set up

**What You'll Need:**

* Your smartphone or computer
* Access to your social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
* A few minutes to adjust settings

---

## Understanding the Problem

Social media apps are designed to keep you engaged. They use colors, notifications, and endless scrolling to make you want to check "just one more time." Before you know it, 20 minutes has become two hours.

**This is not your fault.** The apps are built this way on purpose. But you can take back control.

**Signs you might want to cut back:**

* You check social media first thing when you wake up
* You feel anxious when you can't access your accounts
* You lose track of time while scrolling
* You ignore people around you to check your phone
* You go to bed later than planned because you're scrolling
* You feel worse about yourself after using social media

---

## Step 1: Check How Much Time You're Actually Spending

Before you make changes, it helps to know where you're starting. Your phone tracks how much time you spend on each app.

## On iPhone

1. Open **Settings** (the gray gear icon).
2. Scroll down and tap **Screen Time**.
3. Tap **See All Activity**.
4. Look at the graph showing your daily usage.
5. Scroll down to see which apps you use most.

**What you'll see:** A chart showing hours per day, plus a list of your most-used apps.

## On Android

1. Open **Settings** (the gear icon).
2. Tap **Digital Wellbeing & parental controls** (or search for "Digital Wellbeing").
3. Look at the circle chart showing today's usage.
4. Tap the chart to see more details.
5. Scroll down to see app usage breakdown.

**What you'll see:** Time spent on your phone today and this week, broken down by app.

## What the Numbers Mean

* **1-2 hours per day:** Moderate use, probably manageable
* **3-4 hours per day:** Higher than average, worth reducing
* **5+ hours per day:** Excessive use, definitely time to cut back

**Remember:** These are total hours. Even "just checking" Facebook 20 times adds up quickly.

---

## Step 2: Decide How Much Time You Want to Spend

Be realistic. Going from 5 hours to zero won't work. Start with a goal you can actually achieve.

## Setting Your Goal

1. Look at your current usage from Step 1.
2. Pick a number that's about 30% less.
3. Write it down.

**Example:** If you're currently spending 4 hours per day on social media, aim for 2.5-3 hours to start.

**Why start small:** Small changes stick better than dramatic ones. You can always reduce more later.

---

## Step 3: Turn Off Notifications

Notifications are the main reason you check your phone constantly. Every buzz or ding interrupts what you're doing and pulls you back to the app.

## On iPhone (Notification Settings)

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Tap **Notifications**.
3. Scroll down to find **Facebook** (or Instagram, Twitter, etc.).
4. Tap the app name.
5. Turn off **Allow Notifications** (the toggle should turn gray).
6. Repeat for each social media app.

**What happens:** You'll no longer get alerts when someone likes your post or comments. You can still check manually whenever you want.

## On Android (Notification Settings)

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Tap **Apps** (or **Notifications**).
3. Find and tap **Facebook** (or your other social media apps).
4. Tap **Notifications**.
5. Turn off **Allow notifications**.
6. Repeat for each social media app.

## What About Important Notifications?

**You might worry:** "What if someone needs to reach me?"

**The truth:** If it's truly urgent, people will call or text. Social media notifications are rarely emergencies. Most are just someone liking a photo from three days ago.

**Optional middle ground:** Keep notifications on for direct messages only. Turn off likes, comments, and other alerts.

---

## Step 4: Set Daily Time Limits

Your phone can remind you when you've used an app too long, or even block the app after a set time.

## On iPhone (Screen Time Limits)

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Tap **Screen Time**.
3. Tap **App Limits**.
4. Tap **Add Limit**.
5. Tap **Social Networking** (this covers Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc.).
6. Tap **Next** (top-right).
7. Set your daily time limit (start with 1-2 hours).
8. Tap **Add** (top-right).

**What happens:** When you reach your limit, the app's icon will gray out and you'll see a message saying "Time Limit." You can ignore it and keep using the app, or you can stop for the day.

**Making it stricter:** Turn on **Block at End of Limit** if you want the app to actually stop working when time runs out.

## On Android (Digital Wellbeing Timers)

1. Open **Settings**.
2. Tap **Digital Wellbeing & parental controls**.
3. Tap **Dashboard**.
4. Next to Facebook (or another app), tap the timer icon (looks like an hourglass).
5. Set your daily time limit.
6. Tap **OK**.

**What happens:** When time runs out, the app pauses for the rest of the day. You'll see a message saying you've reached your daily limit.

## Choosing Your Time Limit

Start with something achievable:

* **Heavy users (4+ hours):** Set limit to 2 hours
* **Moderate users (2-3 hours):** Set limit to 1 hour
* **Light users (under 1 hour):** Set limit to 30 minutes

You can always adjust later.

## Step 5: Remove Apps from Your Home Screen

Out of sight, out of mind. If you have to search for an app instead of seeing it right there, you'll use it less.

## On iPhone (Home Screen Settings)

1. Find the app icon on your home screen.
2. Press and hold the app icon until a menu appears.
3. Tap **Remove App**.
4. Tap **Remove from Home Screen** (not Delete App).

**What happens:** The app stays on your phone but moves to the App Library. You can still use it by swiping left to the last page and searching, but you won't see it every time you unlock your phone.

## On Android (Home Screen Settings)

1. Find the app icon on your home screen.
2. Press and hold the app icon.
3. Drag it to **Remove** at the top of the screen.

**What happens:** The app disappears from your home screen but stays installed. You can find it in your app drawer (swipe up from the bottom).

**Why this works:** You'll stop opening apps out of habit. You'll only open them when you actually want to use them.

---

## Step 6: Schedule "Social Media Time"

Instead of checking constantly throughout the day, choose specific times to use social media.

## Choosing Your Schedule

Pick 2-3 times per day when you'll check social media:

* **Morning:** After breakfast (15-30 minutes)
* **Midday:** During lunch break (15-30 minutes)
* **Evening:** After dinner (30-45 minutes)

**Why this works:** When you know you have dedicated time later, it's easier to resist checking right now.

## How to Stick to Your Schedule

1. **Set a timer:** When you start your social media time, set a timer on your phone for 20-30 minutes.
2. **When it goes off, stop:** Close the app and move on with your day.
3. **Be consistent:** Use the same times each day so it becomes routine.

**If you slip up:** Don't quit entirely. Just get back on schedule with your next session.

---

## Step 7: Find Alternatives to Scrolling

When you cut back on social media, you'll have free time. Fill it with something you enjoy, or you'll drift back to scrolling.

## Ideas for Free Time

**At home:**

* Read a book or magazine
* Call a friend or family member to actually talk
* Work on a hobby (puzzles, crafts, gardening)
* Watch a show you've been meaning to see
* Cook a new recipe
* Take a walk around your neighborhood
* Listen to music or a podcast

**While waiting (doctor's office, in line):**

* Read a book you keep in your bag
* Do a crossword puzzle
* People-watch
* Strike up a conversation with someone nearby
* Simply sit and think (it's okay to be bored sometimes)

**The key:** Have a plan. "I'll read instead of scroll" works better than "I'll do something else."

---

## Step 8: Make It Harder to Access

Add small obstacles that make you think before opening an app.

## Log Out of Apps

1. Open your social media app.
2. Go to **Settings**.
3. Find **Log Out** and tap it.

**What happens:** Every time you want to use the app, you'll need to type your password. This extra step makes you pause and think, "Do I really want to check this right now?"

**Tip:** Don't let your phone save your password. Type it in each time.

## Delete Apps from Your Phone (Advanced)

If you're serious about cutting back:

1. Delete Facebook, Instagram, or other apps from your phone entirely.
2. Only check them on your computer.
3. This makes casual scrolling much harder.

**You won't lose your account.** The app and your account are separate. You can always reinstall the app later if you change your mind.

---

## Step 9: Recognize Your Triggers

Pay attention to when and why you reach for social media.

## Common Triggers

* **Boredom:** Nothing to do, so you scroll
* **Anxiety:** Feeling worried, so you distract yourself
* **Habit:** Waiting in line, so you automatically check your phone
* **FOMO:** Fear of missing out on news or what friends are doing
* **Procrastination:** Avoiding a task you don't want to do

## Breaking the Pattern

1. **Notice the trigger:** "I'm bored, so I want to check Facebook."
2. **Pause:** Wait 60 seconds before opening the app.
3. **Ask yourself:** "Will scrolling actually help, or will it make me feel worse?"
4. **Choose a different action:** Call someone, read an article, or simply sit with the feeling.

**Over time:** The urge to check will get weaker.

---

## Step 10: Create Phone-Free Zones

Decide on specific times or places where you won't use your phone at all.

## Phone-Free Times

* **First hour after waking up:** Start your day without screens
* **During meals:** Be present while eating
* **Last hour before bed:** Better sleep without blue light and stimulation
* **While spending time with family:** Give them your full attention

## Phone-Free Places

* **Bedroom:** Leave your phone charging in another room overnight
* **Dining table:** No phones during family meals
* **Bathroom:** Don't bring your phone with you

**Why this works:** These boundaries protect your sleep, relationships, and mental health.

---

## Dealing with Withdrawal

When you first cut back, you might feel anxious or restless. This is normal.

## What You Might Feel

* **Phantom vibrations:** Thinking your phone buzzed when it didn't
* **Urge to check:** Strong desire to see what's happening online
* **Anxiety:** Worry that you're missing something important
* **Boredom:** Not knowing what to do with free time

## How to Handle It

**Week 1:** The hardest. You'll feel the urge constantly. Remind yourself this is temporary.

**Week 2:** Gets easier. The urges become less intense.

**Week 3-4:** Much better. New habits start to feel normal.

**If you slip up:** Don't give up entirely. Just restart your limits and keep going.

## Safety Tip: Watch Your Mental Health

Pay attention to how social media affects your mood.

## Warning Signs Social Media Is Hurting You

* You feel worse about your life after scrolling
* You compare yourself to others constantly
* You feel jealous of friends' posts
* You get into arguments in comments
* You check obsessively to see how many likes you got
* You post things just to get validation from others

## What to Do

If social media consistently makes you feel bad:

* **Unfollow accounts** that trigger negative feelings (even if they're friends)
* **Mute people** without unfriending them
* **Take a complete break** for a week and see how you feel
* **Talk to someone** about what you're experiencing

**Remember:** Social media shows everyone's highlight reel, not their real life. Those perfect photos don't show the messy parts everyone has.

## Talking to Family About Your Changes

If you're cutting back on social media, let people know so they support you instead of pulling you back in.

## What to Say

"I'm trying to spend less time on my phone. If you need me, please call or text instead of messaging on Facebook."

"I'm checking social media less often, so I might not respond to comments right away."

"I've turned off notifications, so I won't see your messages immediately. I'll check once or twice a day."

## Setting Boundaries with Friends

Some friends might not understand:

* "Why didn't you like my post?"
* "Did you see what I shared?"
* "You never comment on my pictures anymore."

**You can say:** "I'm trying to use social media less, but I still care about you. Let's talk on the phone or meet up instead."

**You don't owe anyone:** Constant engagement with their posts. Real friendships survive without likes and comments.

---

## Measuring Your Progress

After a week or two, check your screen time again (Step 1) and compare it to when you started.

## Signs of Success

* **Time decreased:** You're spending less time on social media
* **Better sleep:** You fall asleep faster and sleep better
* **More present:** You're engaged with people around you
* **Less anxious:** You feel calmer without constant notifications
* **Free time:** You're doing things you enjoy instead of scrolling

## If You're Not Seeing Progress

* **Your limits might be too ambitious:** Start with smaller reductions
* **You might need stronger boundaries:** Try deleting apps entirely for a week
* **You might need more structure:** Write out a specific schedule and stick to it

**Don't quit.** Changing habits takes time. Every small improvement counts.

## Common Questions

**Q: What if I need Facebook for important groups or events?**  
A: Check it on your computer instead of your phone. Or keep the app but use the time limits in Step 4. You can still use Facebook—just less often and more intentionally.

**Q: Won't I miss important news if I'm not checking constantly?**  
A: Truly important news will reach you. Friends will tell you, family will call, and you'll still see it when you check during your scheduled times. Most "breaking news" on social media isn't urgent.

**Q: I use social media to stay in touch with distant family. What should I do?**  
A: Schedule regular video calls instead. A 15-minute video chat is more meaningful than a week of liking each other's posts. You can still use social media, but supplement it with real conversations.

**Q: What if I need social media for work?**  
A: Create separate accounts—one for work and one for personal use. Only check the work account during work hours. Keep the personal account off your phone or heavily limited.

**Q: I feel guilty for not liking my friends' posts anymore. What should I do?**  
A: Real friends will understand. If someone gets upset about not getting likes, that's about them, not you. You're not required to engage with every post from every person you know.

**Q: What if I get bored without social media?**  
A: Boredom is okay. In fact, it's healthy. Boredom often leads to creativity, reflection, or trying new things. Give yourself permission to simply sit and think sometimes.

**Q: How do I explain to older family members why I'm not responding to their Facebook messages?**  
A: Teach them to text or call you instead. Say, "I'm checking Facebook less often now. If you need to reach me, send a regular text message and I'll see it right away."

**Q: What if I'm worried I'll miss out on events or invitations?**  
A: Check once a day for events and messages. That's enough to stay informed without constant scrolling. Or ask friends to text you about important events instead of only posting them on Facebook.

**Q: Is it rude to ignore social media messages?**  
A: No. You can check them on your own schedule. People managed friendships before instant messaging existed. It's okay to respond once a day instead of immediately.

**Q: Can I take a complete break from social media?**  
A: Absolutely. Many people take "social media breaks" for a week, a month, or longer. Your accounts will still be there when you come back. You might find you don't miss it as much as you thought.
