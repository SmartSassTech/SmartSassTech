Keep your personal information safe and prevent identity thieves from stealing your life.

## What Is Identity Theft?

Identity theft happens when someone steals your personal information (name, Social Security number, credit card, etc.) and uses it to:

* Open credit cards or loans in your name
* File fake tax returns to steal your refund
* Access your bank accounts
* Get medical treatment using your insurance
* Commit crimes under your name

**The damage:** Identity theft can ruin your credit score, cost thousands of dollars, and take years to fix.

## 1. Guard Your Social Security Number

Your Social Security number (SSN) is the key to your identity. Protect it like cash.

## When You Should Give Your SSN

* Opening a bank account
* Applying for credit (loans, credit cards, mortgages)
* Filing taxes
* Starting a new job
* Applying for government benefits

## When You Should NOT Give Your SSN

* Signing up for a store loyalty card
* Making routine purchases
* Registering for most websites
* When someone calls or emails asking for it
* To anyone who "just needs it to verify your identity" unexpectedly

**Golden rule:** If someone asks for your SSN, ask why they need it and how they'll protect it. If their answer isn't satisfactory, don't provide it.

## Protect Your SSN Card

* **Don't carry it in your wallet** — leave it at home in a secure location
* **Don't email or text your SSN** to anyone
* **Shred documents** containing your SSN before throwing them away

## 2. Monitor Your Credit Reports

Your credit report shows all accounts opened in your name. Check it regularly for fraud.

## How to Check Your Credit Report (Free)

* Visit **AnnualCreditReport.com** (the only official free site)
* You can check once per year from each of the three bureaus: Equifax, Experian, TransUnion
* **Pro tip:** Check one bureau every 4 months to monitor year-round

## What to Look For

* **Accounts you didn't open** (credit cards, loans, mortgages)
* **Hard inquiries you didn't authorize** (applications for credit)
* **Addresses you never lived at**
* **Employers you never worked for**

**If you find errors:** File a dispute with the credit bureau immediately using their online dispute process.

## 3. Consider a Credit Freeze

A credit freeze prevents anyone (including you) from opening new credit accounts in your name.

## How Credit Freezes Work

* **Free at all three bureaus** (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
* **Stops identity thieves** from opening accounts in your name
* **You control it** — unfreeze temporarily when you need to apply for credit

## How to Freeze Your Credit

Contact each bureau separately:

1. **Equifax:** equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-freeze
2. **Experian:** experian.com/freeze/center.html
3. **TransUnion:** transunion.com/credit-freeze

* **Save your PIN or password** — you'll need it to unfreeze
* **It's free** — ignore any paid services they try to sell you

**When to unfreeze:** Before applying for a credit card, loan, apartment, or job that will check your credit.

## 4. Use Fraud Alerts

A fraud alert makes it harder for identity thieves to open accounts by requiring extra verification.

## How Fraud Alerts Work

* **Free and easier than a freeze** (only need to contact one bureau)
* **Lasts 1 year** (or 7 years for identity theft victims)
* **Creditors must verify your identity** before opening accounts

## How to Set Up a Fraud Alert

Contact **one** of the three bureaus (they'll notify the others):

* **Equifax:** 1-800-525-6285
* **Experian:** 1-888-397-3742
* **TransUnion:** 1-800-680-7289

**Fraud alert vs. credit freeze:** Alerts are easier to set up but less secure than freezes. Consider using both.

## 5. Protect Your Personal Information Online

The less you share, the less thieves can steal.

## Limit What You Share on Social Media

Identity thieves gather information from your social media profiles to answer security questions or impersonate you.

* **Don't post:** Full birth date, phone number, home address, vacation plans
* **Avoid:** Posting your location in real-time
* **Be cautious with:** Quizzes and games asking personal questions ("What's your mother's maiden name?")
* **Lock down privacy settings** so only friends can see your posts

## Be Smart with Security Questions

Security questions are easy for thieves to guess or research.

* **Don't use real answers** — make up fake but memorable answers
* **Example:** Instead of your actual mother's maiden name, use "PurpleElephant42"
* **Store fake answers** in your password manager so you don't forget them

## Review Your Digital Footprint

Search for yourself periodically:

* **Google yourself:** See what public information appears
* **Check people-search sites:** Spokeo, Whitepages, BeenVerified (you can request removal)
* **Review old accounts:** Delete accounts you no longer use

## 6. Watch Out for Phishing and Social Engineering

Identity thieves trick you into giving up information through fake emails, calls, and texts.

## Common Tactics

* **Fake emails:** "Your account has been compromised! Click here to verify your information"
* **Phone scams:** "This is the IRS. You owe back taxes. Pay immediately or face arrest"
* **Text messages:** "Your package is waiting. Click to reschedule delivery"
* **Fake tech support:** "We've detected a virus on your computer. Let us fix it remotely"

## How to Protect Yourself

* **Never click links** in unsolicited emails or texts
* **Don't trust caller ID** — scammers can fake it
* **Hang up and call back** using the official number from the company's website
* **Government agencies never call demanding immediate payment**
* **No legitimate company asks for passwords or SSN over the phone**

**When in doubt:** Hang up, delete the email, or ignore the text. Then contact the company directly using official channels.

## 7. Secure Your Mail

Physical mail contains sensitive information thieves can use.

## Protect Incoming Mail

* **Collect mail promptly** — don't let it sit in your mailbox overnight
* **Use a locked mailbox** or P.O. box if possible
* **Hold mail when traveling** through USPS Hold Mail service

## Protect Outgoing Mail

* **Drop bills at the post office** instead of leaving them in your mailbox
* **Shred sensitive documents:** Bank statements, credit card offers, medical bills, tax documents

**What to shred:** Anything with your name, address, account numbers, or SSN.

## 8. Respond Quickly to Data Breaches

When companies announce data breaches, act immediately.

## Steps to Take After a Breach

1. **Change your password** for the affected account (and anywhere you reused that password)
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** if you haven't already
3. **Monitor your accounts** for suspicious activity
4. **Check your credit report** for new accounts you didn't open
5. **Consider a credit freeze** if sensitive information was exposed (SSN, date of birth)

**Sign up for breach alerts:** Services like Have I Been Pwned (haveibeenpwned.com) notify you if your email appears in a breach.

## 9. Use Identity Theft Protection Services (Optional)

Identity theft protection services monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity.

## What They Do

* **Monitor credit reports** from all three bureaus
* **Alert you to new accounts** opened in your name
* **Scan the dark web** for your personal information
* **Provide identity theft insurance** and recovery assistance

## Popular Services

* **Paid options:** LifeLock, Identity Guard, Aura, IdentityForce ($10-30/month)
* **Free options:** Credit Karma (credit monitoring), Have I Been Pwned (breach alerts)
* **Bank/credit card perks:** Many banks offer free credit monitoring — check with yours

**Do you need it?** Not essential if you monitor your own credit and practice good security habits, but offers convenience and peace of mind.

## 10. Know the Warning Signs of Identity Theft

Catch identity theft early to minimize damage.

## Red Flags

* **Bills stop arriving** — thief may have changed your address
* **Denied for credit** when you have good credit
* **Collection calls** for debts you don't owe
* **Medical bills** for services you didn't receive
* **Tax return rejected** — someone already filed using your SSN
* **Strange charges** on your bank or credit card statements
