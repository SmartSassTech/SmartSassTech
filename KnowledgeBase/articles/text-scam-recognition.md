title: How to Recognize Common Text Message Scams
---

"Smishing" (SMS phishing) is when scammers use text messages to trick you into clicking malicious links or sharing personal information.

## Top 5 Text Scams

1. **Fake Delivery:** "USPS/UPS: Your package addresses is incomplete. Click here to update."
2. **Bank Alerts:** "Chase/Wells Fargo: Account locked due to suspicious login. Verify identity here."
3. **Toll Violations:** "E-ZPass/SunPass: You have an unpaid toll of $4.50. Pay now to avoid late fees."
4. **Prize Winners:** "CONGRATS! You won a $500 Amazon Gift Card. Click to claim."
5. **Wrong Number:** "Hi is this John? It's Sarah..." (Attempts to build a conversation for romance/investment scams).

## How to Spot a Fake

* **Urgency:** The message demands you act *immediately* or face a consequence (account closed, fine, lost package).
* **Suspicious Links:** URLs that look wrong (e.g., `usps-delivery-status.com` instead of `usps.com`) or use shorteners like `bit.ly`.
* **Personal Info Requests:** Real banks and companies will *never* ask for your password, PIN, or full Social Security number via text.
* **Random Numbers:** Official alerts usually come from shortcodes (5-6 digits), not standard 10-digit phone numbers.

## What to Do

* **Don't Click:** Never tap a link in an unexpected text.
* **Don't Reply:** Even typing "STOP" confirms your number is active to scammers.
* **Verify Separately:** Log in to the official app or website directly (not through the link) to check for alerts.
* **Report It:** Forward the message to **7726 (SPAM)**. This works for most major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) to flag the sender.
