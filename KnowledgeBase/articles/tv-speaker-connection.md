title: How to Connect External Speakers or a Soundbar to Your TV
---

Improve your TV's sound by connecting a soundbar, Bluetooth speaker, or headphones.

## 1. Connecting a Soundbar (Best Quality)

The best way to connect a soundbar is using the **HDMI ARC** port.

1. **Check Ports:** Find the HDMI port labeled **ARC** or **eARC** on your TV and the soundbar.
2. **Connect:** Plug an HDMI cable into both ARC ports.
3. **Tv Settings:** Go to **Settings > Sound > Audio Output** and select **HDMI / Receiver / ARC**.
4. **Benefits:** This connection usually allows your **TV remote** to control the soundbar's volume automatically.

**Alternative (Optical):** If you don't have HDMI ARC, use an **Optical Digital Cable** (small square connector). Note that with optical, you usually must use the soundbar's remote to control volume.

## 2. Connecting Bluetooth Headphones/Speakers

Great for private listening without disturbing others.

1. **Pairing Mode:** Put your headphones or speaker into pairing mode (usually by holding the Bluetooth/Power button until a light flashes).
2. **TV Settings:** Go to **Settings > Sound > Bluetooth Speaker List** (or "Sound Out > Bluetooth").
3. **Connect:** Select your device from the list.

## 3. Wired Headphones / Older Speakers

* **Headphone Jack (3.5mm):** Look for a small round port labeled with a headphone icon. Plug in directly.
* **RCA (Red/White):** On older TVs, use the Red/White **Audio Out** ports. You may need an RCA-to-3.5mm adapter for computer speakers.

## Troubleshooting

* **No Sound?** Ensure the soundbar is on the correct "Input" (e.g., set to "TV" or "HDMI").
* **Lip Sync Issues?** If the sound doesn't match the picture, go to **Settings > Sound > Audio Delay** (or "AV Sync") to adjust it.
* **Echo?** If sound comes from both the TV and speakers, mute the TV or turn "TV Speaker" to **OFF** in settings.
