Stay safe on Facebook by securing your account and being careful about what you share.

## 1. Run a Privacy Checkup

Facebook has a built-in tool to fix most privacy issues.

1. Click your **Profile Picture** in the top right corner.
2. Select **Settings & privacy > Privacy Checkup**.
3. Follow the on-screen steps. **Crucial Step:** Set "Who can see what you share" to **Friends** (not Public).

## 2. Secure Your Account

* **Strong Password:** Use a unique password not used on other sites.
* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Go to **Settings > Security and login > Use two-factor authentication**. This sends a code to your phone if a hacker tries to log in.

## 3. Spotting Common Scams

* **"Is this you?" Videos:** Never click links in messages asking if you are in a video. It is a trick to steal your password.
* **Emergency Money Requests:** If a "friend" messages asking for money or gift cards because they are in trouble, **call them** to verify. Their account was likely hacked.
* **Duplicate Friend Requests:** If you get a request from someone you are already friends with, it is a fake "clone" account. Reject and report it.

## 4. How to Report or Block

* **Block:** Go to the person's profile, click the **three dots (...)**, and select **Block**.
* **Report:** Click the **three dots** on any profile or post and select **Find support or report**.
