Using your phone while driving can be dangerous and distracting. **Android Auto** is a free feature that connects your phone to your car’s dashboard screen, making it safer to see directions, answer calls, and listen to music.

## 🕒 Quick Overview

* **Total Time:** 15 minutes.
* **The Goal:** To see your phone's maps and buttons on your car's big screen.
* **What You Need:** Your Android phone and your phone’s charging cord.

## Step 1: Connect Your Phone to Your Car

Most people connect using the same charging cord they use at home.

1. **Park your car** in a safe spot and start the engine.
2. **Plug your charging cord** into your phone.
3. **Plug the other end** into the USB port in your car.
    * *Tip: Look for a USB port with a small picture of a **phone** or the word **"Data"** next to it.*
4. **Look at your phone screen.** It may ask if you want to "Allow" the car to connect. Tap **"Allow"** or **"Agree."**
5. **Look at your car’s dashboard screen.** A new button labeled **Android Auto** should appear. Tap it with your finger.

## Step 2: How to Talk to Your Car

The safest way to use this system is to talk to it so you don't have to look away from the road.

* **To get the car’s attention:** Say **"Hey Google"** out loud, or press the **Microphone button** located on your steering wheel.
* **To go somewhere:** Say, *"Take me to the nearest grocery store."*
* **To call someone:** Say, *"Call my daughter, Sarah."*
* **To send a text:** Say, *"Send a text to John."* The car will ask what you want to say, and it will read your message back to you before it sends it.

## Step 3: Understanding the Screen

Once Android Auto is open, you will see a few icons at the bottom of your car's screen. Think of these as your "Home Base."

| Icon | What it does |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Circle or Grid** | This is the "Home" button. It shows all your available apps. |
| **Map Icon** | This opens your GPS for directions and traffic updates. |
| **Phone Icon** | This lets you see your recent calls or your contact list. |
| **Headphones** | This opens your music, news, or audiobooks. |

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting: "It’s Not Working"

If your car screen stays blank after you plug in your phone, try these simple fixes:

1. **Check the Cord:** Some charging cords are only for power and cannot "talk" to the car. If it doesn't work, try the original cord that came in the box with your phone.
2. **Unlock Your Phone:** If your phone screen is black/locked, the car might not recognize it. Swipe your phone open once.
3. **Try a Different USB Port:** Many cars have two or three USB plugs. Usually, only one of them is connected to the dashboard screen. Try the others!

## 🛡️ Safety & Confidence Tips

* **Practice in your driveway:** Don't try to learn how to use this while you are driving down the road. Spend 10 minutes playing with the buttons while parked.
* **The "Unplug" Rule:** If the system ever gets stuck or confused, simply **unplug the cord.** Your phone and your car will both go back to their normal screens immediately.
* **No Videos:** For your safety, Android Auto will not show videos or social media. It is designed to keep you focused on driving.
