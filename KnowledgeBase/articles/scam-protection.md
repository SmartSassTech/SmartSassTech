title: How to Spot and Avoid Online Scams
---

Scammers are constantly changing their tactics, but the warning signs remain the same. This guide helps you recognize and avoid fraud.

## The "Golden Rule" of Fraud Prevention

> **Warning:** If someone contacts you unexpectedly and asks for money or personal information, it is almost certainly a scam.

## Universal Red Flags

No matter the story, scammers will almost always use these three tactics:

1. **Urgency:** They try to make you panic ("You'll be arrested", "Your account will be closed") so you act without thinking.
2. **Payment Method:** They demand payment via **Gift Cards**, **Cryptocurrency**, or **Wire Transfers**. Legitimate businesses and government agencies *never* require these methods.
3. **Secrecy:** They might tell you to lie to the bank teller or not to tell your family.

## Common Types of Scams

* **Phishing Emails/Texts:** Messages looking like they are from Amazon, Netflix, or your bank asking you to click a link to "unlock your account".
* **Tech Support Fraud:** A pop-up on your computer claiming you have a virus and giving a number to call. *Microsoft and Apple will never call you to fix your computer.*
* **Imposter Scams:** Callers claiming to be the IRS, Medicare, or a grandchild in trouble.
* **Romance Scams:** Online relationships where the person professes love quickly but needs money for an "emergency" and refuses to meet in person.

## What To Do If You Suspect a Scam

1. **STOP:** Do not pay. Do not click links. Do not answer questions.
2. **VERIFY:** Hang up or close the message. Contact the company or person directly using a trusted phone number (like the one on the back of your credit card).
3. **REPORT:**
    * **Federal Trade Commission:** [ReportFraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/)
    * **Internet Crime:** [IC3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov/)
    * **Phishing Emails:** Forward to `spam@uce.gov`.
