## Getting Started with Social Media

## Creating an Account

The basic process is similar across platforms:

1. **Download the app** or visit the website
2. **Sign up** with your email, phone number, or existing account (like Google)
3. **Create a username** — your unique identifier (can often be changed later)
4. **Add a profile picture** — helps people recognize you
5. **Fill out your profile** — add bio, interests, location (optional)
6. **Find friends** — search for people you know or import contacts

**Privacy tip:** You don't have to fill out everything. Share only what you're comfortable with.

## Understanding Your Profile

**Profile picture:** The photo that represents you (also called avatar or profile pic)

**Bio:** A short description about you

* **Good examples:** "Dog lover | Coffee addict | NYC"
* Keep it brief (most platforms have character limits)

**Username vs. Display Name:**

* **Username:** Your unique handle (like @johnsmith123) — used to tag and find you
* **Display Name:** What people see first (like "John Smith") — can usually be changed anytime

## How to Use Social Media Safely

## Lock Down Your Privacy Settings

**For every platform you join:**

1. Go to **Settings** or **Privacy Settings**
2. Set your profile to **Private** (especially if you're new)
   * **Private:** Only approved followers/friends see your posts
   * **Public:** Anyone can see what you post
3. Control who can:
   * See your posts
   * Send you messages
   * Tag you in photos
   * See your friends list
   * Find you through search

**Best practice:** Start private, then adjust as you get comfortable.

## Think Before You Post

Once something is online, it's there forever—even if you delete it.

**Questions to ask before posting:**

* Would I be okay with my boss/parents/future employer seeing this?
* Could this embarrass me or someone else later?
* Am I sharing too much personal information?
* Could this be misunderstood or taken out of context?

**Red flags—don't post:**

* Your full address or location in real-time
* Your phone number
* Your full birth date (year can help identity thieves)
* Vacation plans while you're away (tells thieves your house is empty)
* Photos of your credit cards, ID, or other sensitive documents
* Anything when you're angry or emotional (wait and cool down)

## Watch What You Share About Others

* **Don't post photos of others** without their permission
* **Don't share others' personal information** (phone numbers, addresses)
* **Don't tag people** in embarrassing or unflattering posts
* **Respect boundaries** — not everyone wants to be on social media

**Golden rule:** Treat others how you'd want to be treated.

## Be Careful Who You Connect With

* **Don't accept friend requests** from people you don't know
* **Be skeptical of profiles** that seem fake (no posts, few friends, stolen photos)
* **Watch for impersonation** — scammers create fake accounts pretending to be friends
* **Never send money** to people you've only met online

**Red flags for fake accounts:**

* Profile picture is a model or celebrity
* Very few posts or friends
* Asks personal questions right away
* Wants to move conversation off the platform quickly

## Understanding How Social Media Works

## The Feed/Timeline

* Your main page showing posts from people you follow
* **Algorithm decides** what you see (not chronological)
* Platforms show you content they think you'll engage with

**Why you might not see everything:**

* Algorithms prioritize popular or engaging content
* You can't see every post from everyone you follow
* Paid ads are mixed into your feed

## Likes, Comments, and Shares

* **Like/Heart:** Shows you enjoyed the post
* **Comment:** Add your thoughts or reply to the post
* **Share/Retweet:** Send the post to your own followers

**Be thoughtful:** Your likes and comments are usually public. Others can see what you interact with.

## Stories

* Temporary posts that disappear after 24 hours
* Less formal than regular posts
* Can include photos, videos, polls, questions
* Available on Instagram, Facebook, Snapchat

## Direct Messages (DMs)

* Private messages between you and other users
* More personal than commenting publicly
* **Warning:** DMs aren't always as private as you think—screenshots exist

## Social Media Etiquette

Follow these unwritten rules to be a good digital citizen:

## Do

* **Be kind and respectful** in comments and posts
* **Give credit** when sharing others' content
* **Fact-check** before sharing news or information
* **Use appropriate language** for your audience
* **Respect different opinions** even when you disagree

## Don't

* **Overshare** — no one needs 50 photos from the same event
* **Vaguebook** — posting cryptic messages for attention ("I can't believe this happened...")
* **Argue publicly** — heated debates rarely end well online
* **Spam** — repeatedly posting the same thing or tagging people unnecessarily
* **Brag excessively** — a little sharing is fine, constant humble-bragging is annoying

## Recognizing Common Social Media Scams

Stay alert for these red flags:

## Fake Giveaways

* "Share this post and tag 10 friends to win an iPhone!"
* **Reality:** They're collecting followers or personal information

## Phishing Links

* "You've been tagged in a photo!" (link goes to a fake login page)
* **Reality:** Trying to steal your password

## Romance Scams

* Someone you've never met professes love and asks for money
* **Reality:** Professional scammers targeting lonely people

## Job Offers

* "Make $5,000 a week working from home!" (requires upfront payment)
* **Reality:** Pyramid schemes or scams

## Impersonation

* Someone creates an account pretending to be your friend
* **Reality:** Trying to scam you or your other friends

**What to do:** Report suspicious accounts, don't click suspicious links, verify with friends directly if something seems off.

## Dealing with Negativity

## Cyberbullying

If someone is harassing, threatening, or repeatedly being mean to you online:

* **Block them** immediately (available on all platforms)
* **Don't engage** — responding often makes it worse
* **Save evidence** — take screenshots before blocking
* **Report to the platform** using built-in reporting tools
* **Tell someone** — parent, friend, counselor, or authority figure
* **Report to police** if there are threats of violence

**Remember:** It's not your fault. No one deserves to be bullied.

## Negative Comments

* **Don't feed the trolls** — some people just want attention
* **Delete and block** if comments are abusive
* **Disable comments** on posts if needed
* **Take breaks** if social media is affecting your mental health

## Understanding Misinformation

Not everything you see online is true.

## How to Spot Fake News

* **Check the source** — is it from a reputable news organization?
* **Look at the date** — old news sometimes resurfaces
* **Read beyond the headline** — headlines can be misleading
* **Check other sources** — can you find the same story elsewhere?
* **Look for author credentials** — who wrote it and why?
* **Be skeptical of extreme claims** — if it sounds too crazy to be true, verify it

**Before sharing:** Make sure it's accurate. Spreading misinformation harms everyone.

## Edited Photos and Videos

* Photos can be altered or taken out of context
* Videos can be edited or deepfaked
* **Look for inconsistencies** in lighting, shadows, proportions
* **Check if others are reporting the same thing**

## Managing Your Time on Social Media

Social media can be addictive. Set healthy boundaries:

## Signs You Might Be Using Too Much

* Checking your phone first thing when you wake up
* Feeling anxious when you can't access social media
* Comparing yourself to others and feeling bad
* Losing sleep to scroll
* Ignoring real-life activities and relationships

## Tips to Cut Back

* **Set time limits** — use built-in screen time tools
* **Turn off notifications** — check on your schedule, not theirs
* **No phones at meals** or during family time
* **Delete apps temporarily** if you need a break
* **Follow accounts that make you feel good** — unfollow those that don't

**Remember:** Social media should enhance your life, not replace it.

## For Parents: Keeping Kids Safe

If your children use social media:

* **Know what platforms they use** and create your own accounts
* **Follow or friend them** so you can monitor (but respect their space)
* **Review privacy settings** together
* **Talk about what's appropriate** to post and share
* **Set screen time limits** and enforce them
* **Keep devices in common areas** when possible
* **Be someone they can come to** if something bad happens

**Age limits exist for a reason** — wait until your child is mature enough.

## Protecting Your Mental Health

Social media affects mental health differently for everyone:

**Potential benefits:**

* Staying connected with loved ones
* Finding communities with shared interests
* Learning new things
* Creative expression

**Potential risks:**

* Comparison and jealousy
* FOMO (fear of missing out)
* Cyberbullying
* Sleep disruption
* Addiction

**Take care of yourself:**

* **Take regular breaks** from social media
* **Curate your feed** — follow accounts that inspire you
* **Remember it's a highlight reel** — people show their best moments, not reality
* **Seek help** if social media is making you anxious or depressed

## Deleting Your Account

If you decide social media isn't for you:

* **Deactivate temporarily** — takes a break but keeps your account
* **Delete permanently** — removes everything (often can't be undone)
* **Download your data first** — save photos and memories
* **Tell friends** how to reach you offline

**You're not missing out** — many people live happily without social media.
