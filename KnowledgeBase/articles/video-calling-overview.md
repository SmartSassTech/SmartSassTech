title: How to Make a Video Call
---

Video calling helps you stay connected with friends and family face-to-face. Here are the basics for the most popular apps.

## Choosing the Right App

* **iPhone to iPhone:** Use **FaceTime**. It's built-in, free, and simple.
* **Any Device (mixing iPhone, Android, Computer):** Use **Zoom** or **Google Meet**. They work on almost everything.
* **International:** Use **WhatsApp**. It uses your internet connection so you avoid expensive long-distance phone charges.

## Quick Start Guides

## FaceTime (Apple Devices)

1. Open the **FaceTime** app (green icon).
2. Tap **New FaceTime**.
3. Type the name or phone number of the person you want to call.
4. Tap the **Video** button (camera icon).

## Zoom (All Devices)

* **To Join:** Usually, someone sends you a link. Just tap the link to join.
* **To Host:** Create a free account at [zoom.us](https://zoom.us). Sign in, tap "New Meeting", then invite others by sending them the link.

## Google Meet (All Devices)

* **To Join:** Click the link sent to you.
* **To Host:** Go to [meet.google.com](https://meet.google.com/) and click "New Meeting" to get a shareable link. No separate app is needed on computers.

## WhatsApp (Mobile)

1. Open a chat with the person you want to call.
2. Tap the **Video Camera** icon in the top right corner.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Can't hear them?** Check your volume. Ensure you haven't accidentally tapped the **Mute** button (microphone icon with a slash).
* **Can't see them?** Ask if their camera is turned on. If your screen is black, check if something is covering your camera lens.
* **Frozen video?** Your internet connection may be weak. Move closer to your Wi-Fi router.
