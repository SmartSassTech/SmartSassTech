title: Complete Guide to Social Media Privacy (Facebook & Instagram)
---

Your social media accounts contain personal information, photos, and details about your life. Privacy settings control who can see what you share. This guide will help you protect your information without giving up the parts of social media you enjoy.

**Estimated Time to Complete:** 30 minutes to read and adjust settings

**What You'll Need:**

* Your smartphone or computer
* Access to your social media accounts (Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
* About 15 minutes per account to adjust settings

---

## Why Privacy Settings Matter

When you post on social media, you're deciding who can see that information. Without proper privacy settings, strangers might be able to see:

* Your full name and birthday
* Where you live or work
* Photos of your family and home
* Where you go and when you're away from home
* Your phone number or email address

**The good news:** You can control most of this. It just takes a few minutes to set up.

**What privacy settings can't do:** Once you post something publicly, it can be screenshot, saved, or shared. Privacy settings help, but the safest approach is to think carefully before posting anything personal.

---

## Understanding Public vs. Private

Before we adjust settings, you need to understand what these terms mean.

### Public

**What it means:** Anyone on the internet can see it. This includes:

* People who aren't your friends
* People who don't have a social media account
* Search engines like Google

**When to use it:** Almost never, unless you're a business or public figure.

## Friends (or Followers)

**What it means:** Only people you've accepted as friends (or approved as followers) can see it.

**When to use it:** For most of your personal posts.

## Friends of Friends

**What it means:** Your friends and anyone they're friends with can see it.

**The problem:** You don't know your friends' friends. This can still reach hundreds of strangers.

**When to use it:** Rarely. It's better to stick with "Friends only."

## Only Me

**What it means:** Only you can see it.

**When to use it:** For private notes or memories you want to save but not share.

---

## Step 1: Check Your Current Privacy Settings

Let's see what your current settings are before we change anything.

### On Facebook (Phone or Computer)

1. Open Facebook.
2. Click or tap your **profile picture** (top right on computer, bottom right on phone).
3. Select **Settings & privacy**.
4. Tap or click **Settings**.
5. Select **Privacy** from the left menu (or scroll down to Privacy section on phone).

**What you'll see:** Options for who can see your posts, who can send you friend requests, and more.

### On Instagram (Phone)

1. Open Instagram.
2. Tap your **profile picture** (bottom right).
3. Tap the **three lines** (menu, top right).
4. Tap **Settings and privacy**.
5. Tap **Account privacy**.

**What you'll see:** Options to make your account private or public.

**Note:** These instructions are current as of 2025, but social media companies change their menus frequently. If you can't find something, look for "Settings," "Privacy," or "Security" in the menu.

---

## Step 2: Make Your Facebook Profile Private

These are the most important settings to change on Facebook.

### Control Who Sees Your Future Posts

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy** (as shown in Step 1).
2. Find **Who can see your future posts?**
3. Click or tap it.
4. Select **Friends**.
5. Click or tap **Close** or the back arrow.

**What this does:** From now on, only your friends will see new posts. This doesn't change old posts you've already made.

### Lock Down Old Posts

If you've been using Facebook for a while, you might have old public posts.

1. In the same Privacy section, find **Limit Past Posts** or **Limit who can see past posts**.
2. Tap or click it.
3. Select **Limit Old Posts** or **Confirm**.

**What this does:** Changes all your old public posts to "Friends only." This happens all at once and can't be undone easily, so make sure this is what you want.

**Important:** This only affects posts you made yourself. It doesn't change posts others have tagged you in.

### Control Who Can Send You Friend Requests

1. In Privacy settings, find **Who can send you friend requests?**
2. Choose **Friends of friends** (safer than "Everyone").

**Why this matters:** This reduces random strangers trying to add you.

### Control Who Can Look You Up

1. Still in Privacy settings, find these options:
   * **Who can look you up using the email address you provided?**
   * **Who can look you up using the phone number you provided?**
2. Change both to **Friends** (not "Everyone").

**Why this matters:** This makes it harder for scammers and strangers to find you.

### Prevent Search Engines from Finding You

1. Look for **Do you want search engines outside of Facebook to link to your profile?**
2. Turn this **Off** (the toggle should be gray).

**What this does:** Prevents Google from showing your Facebook profile in search results.

---

## Step 3: Control Who Sees Your Facebook Information

Your profile contains personal details. Let's limit who can see them.

### Adjust Your About Information

1. Go to your profile (click your name or profile picture).
2. Click or tap **About**.
3. For each section (Work and Education, Places Lived, Contact Info, etc.):
   * Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon).
   * Look for the privacy icon (usually a globe, people icons, or a lock).
   * Change it to **Friends** or **Only me**.
   * Click **Save** or the checkmark.

**What to make private:**

* Your phone number (set to "Only me" or remove it entirely)
* Your email address
* Your birthday (or at least hide the year)
* Your home address
* Where you work

**What you can leave as Friends:**

* Your hometown (if you want friends to see it)
* Schools you attended (if you want)
* General interests and hobbies

### Control Who Sees Your Friends List

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy**.
2. Find **Who can see your friends list?**
3. Change it to **Friends** or **Only me**.

**Why this matters:** Scammers look at friends lists to impersonate people you know.

### Review What's On Your Timeline

1. Go to your profile.
2. Look at what's visible to others.
3. For any post you want to change:
   * Click the three dots (•••) in the corner of the post.
   * Select **Edit privacy** or **Edit post**.
   * Change who can see it.
   * Save.

---

## Step 4: Make Your Instagram Account Private

Instagram has simpler privacy settings than Facebook, but they're important.

### Switch to a Private Account

1. Open Instagram.
2. Tap your **profile picture** (bottom right).
3. Tap the **three lines** (menu, top right).
4. Tap **Settings and privacy**.
5. Tap **Account privacy**.
6. Turn on **Private account** (toggle should turn blue).

**What this does:**

* Only people you approve can follow you
* Only your followers can see your posts and stories
* Your posts won't appear in hashtag searches
* Your profile picture and bio are still public

**This is the most important privacy step on Instagram.**

### Control Who Can Tag You

1. In **Settings and privacy**, tap **Tags and mentions**.
2. Under **Allow tags from**, select **People you follow** or **No one**.
3. Under **Allow mentions from**, select **People you follow** or **No one**.

**Why this matters:** Prevents strangers from tagging you in posts or mentioning you in their stories.

### Control Who Can Message You

1. In **Settings and privacy**, tap **Messages and story replies**.
2. Under **Message controls**, you can filter messages from people you don't follow.
3. Consider turning on **Filter requests** to reduce spam.

### Hide Your Activity Status

1. In **Settings and privacy**, tap **Messages and story replies**.
2. Tap **Show activity status**.
3. Turn it **off** (toggle should be gray).

**What this does:** People can't see when you were last active on Instagram.

---

## Step 5: Control Who Sees Your Stories

Stories are temporary posts that disappear after 24 hours, but they still need privacy settings.

### On Facebook

1. When you create a story, look for the privacy selector before posting.
2. Tap it and choose **Friends** (not Public).
3. You can also create a **Close Friends** list and share only with them.

**To create a Close Friends list:**

1. Go to your profile.
2. Tap the three lines (menu).
3. Tap **Close Friends**.
4. Add the people you want to share private stories with.

### On Instagram

1. When you create a story, you can share it to **Your story** (all followers) or **Close friends** (selected people).
2. To create your close friends list:
   * Go to your profile.
   * Tap the three lines (menu).
   * Tap **Close friends**.
   * Add people to the list.

**Why use Close Friends:** Share personal moments with family without broadcasting to everyone who follows you.

---

## Step 6: Manage Photo and Video Privacy

Photos and videos are the most personal content you share.

### Review Photos You're Tagged In

**On Facebook:**

1. Go to your profile.
2. Click **Photos**.
3. Click **Photos of You**.
4. Review photos others have tagged you in.
5. To remove a tag: Click the photo → Click your name → Select **Remove tag**.

**On Instagram:**

1. Go to your profile.
2. Tap the person icon (photos you're tagged in).
3. Review photos.
4. To remove yourself: Tap the photo → Tap the three dots (•••) → **Remove me from post**.

### Control Who Can Post on Your Timeline (Facebook)

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy**.
2. Look for **Profile and Tagging** or similar.
3. Find **Who can post on your profile?**
4. Change to **Friends** or **Only me**.

### Approve Tags Before They Appear

**On Facebook:**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Profile and Tagging**.
2. Find **Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your profile?**
3. Turn it **On**.

**What this does:** You get to approve any photo or post someone tags you in before it shows up on your profile.

---

## Step 7: Location Privacy

Sharing your location can be useful, but it also tells people where you are and when you're not home.

### Turn Off Location on Facebook

1. Go to **Settings** > **Privacy**.
2. Look for **Location** settings.
3. Consider turning off **Location services** entirely, or at minimum:
   * Don't let Facebook access your location in the background
   * Only allow when using the app

### Don't Check In to Locations

When you "check in" to a restaurant or store, you're telling everyone where you are right now.

**Better approach:**

* Post about fun places after you leave, not while you're there
* Skip check-ins entirely for your home, work, or kids' school

### Remove Location from Old Posts

1. Go to old posts that show locations.
2. Click the three dots (•••).
3. Select **Edit post**.
4. Remove the location.
5. Save.

---

## Step 8: Control Third-Party Apps

Apps and games connected to your Facebook account can access your information.

### Review Connected Apps

**On Facebook:**

1. Go to **Settings** > **Apps and websites**.
2. You'll see a list of apps and games that have access to your Facebook data.
3. For each app you don't use or recognize:
   * Click or tap it.
   * Select **Remove**.

**Examples of apps that might be connected:**

* Old games you played years ago
* Websites where you logged in "using Facebook"
* Apps you no longer use

**Why this matters:** These apps can see your profile information, friends list, and sometimes your posts, even if you haven't used them in years.

### Limit What Future Apps Can Access

1. When you connect a new app or game, it will ask for permissions.
2. Read what it's asking for.
3. Only approve what's necessary.
4. If a game asks to see your friends list or post on your behalf, consider not using it.

---

## Step 9: Advertising and Data Privacy

Social media companies make money by showing you ads based on what you do online.

### Limit Ad Tracking on Facebook

1. Go to **Settings** > **Ads** (or **Ad preferences**).
2. Look for **Ad settings** or **Ad topics**.
3. You can:
   * Hide specific ad topics you don't want to see
   * Limit how Facebook uses your activity to show ads
   * See why you're seeing specific ads

**Reality check:** You can't completely stop ads on Facebook, but you can make them less personalized.

### Limit Ad Tracking on Instagram

1. Go to **Settings and privacy** > **Ads**.
2. Review **Ad topics** and hide ones you don't want.
3. Consider limiting how Instagram tracks you across other apps and websites.

### Opt Out of Off-Facebook Activity

Facebook tracks what you do on other websites and apps. You can limit this.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Your Facebook Information**.
2. Click **Off-Facebook activity**.
3. Select **Clear history** to remove past tracking.
4. Select **Manage future activity** and turn it off.

**What this does:** Reduces how much Facebook knows about what you do outside of Facebook.

---

## Step 10: Regular Privacy Checkups

Privacy settings should be reviewed regularly, not just set once and forgotten.

### Facebook Privacy Checkup Tool

1. Go to **Settings & privacy**.
2. Select **Privacy Checkup**.
3. Facebook will walk you through:
   * Who can see what you share
   * How people can find you
   * Your data settings
   * Ad preferences

**Do this:** Every 3-6 months, especially after Facebook updates its features.

### Instagram Privacy Checkup

Instagram doesn't have an automatic checkup, but you should:

1. Review your followers every few months.
2. Remove any accounts you don't recognize.
3. Make sure your account is still set to private.
4. Check your tagged photos.

---

### What to Do If You Made a Mistake

If you accidentally shared something too publicly, here's what to do.

### Delete the Post

1. Go to the post.
2. Click the three dots (•••).
3. Select **Delete** or **Delete post**.
4. Confirm deletion.

**Important:** Deleting removes it from Facebook, but if someone already screenshot it or shared it, those copies remain.

### Change Who Can See It

If you don't want to delete it entirely:

1. Click the three dots (•••) on the post.
2. Select **Edit privacy** or **Edit post**.
3. Change the audience to **Friends** or **Only me**.
4. Save.

### Teaching Others About Your Privacy Choices

If you've made your account more private, some friends and family might notice.

### What to Say

"I've adjusted my privacy settings to share less publicly. If you want to see my posts, make sure we're friends on Facebook."

"I made my Instagram private, so you'll need to follow me if you want to see my posts. I'll approve your request."

"I'm not sharing my location on social media anymore for privacy reasons."

### Setting Boundaries

Some people might push back:

* "Why won't you accept my friend request?" (If you don't know them well)
* "Why can't I tag you in photos?" (If you've restricted tagging)

**You can say:** "I'm keeping my social media more private now. It's not personal—it's just safer this way."

**Remember:** You're not required to be friends with everyone who asks or allow anyone to tag you.

## Common Privacy Mistakes to Avoid

## Mistake 1: Sharing Too Much Personal Information

**Don't post:**

* Your full birthdate (scammers use this for identity theft)
* Your phone number or address
* Photos of your driver's license, credit cards, or other documents
* Vacation plans before or during your trip (tells burglars you're away)
* Your child's school name or schedule

## Mistake 2: Accepting Friend Requests from Strangers

**Why it's risky:**

* Scammers use fake accounts to collect information
* They might try to scam your friends by impersonating you
* They can see everything you post to "Friends"

**What to do:** Only accept requests from people you actually know.

## Mistake 3: Posting Photos That Show Your Location

**Examples:**

* Photos with house numbers visible
* Pictures of your car with license plate showing
* Photos of kids in school uniforms with school name visible
* Images with landmarks that identify where you live

**What to do:** Review photos before posting and crop out identifying details.

## Mistake 4: Using the Same Password Everywhere

**Why it's dangerous:** If one site gets hacked, scammers try that password on all your other accounts.

**What to do:** Use a different password for each social media account. Consider using a password manager to keep track.

## Mistake 5: Not Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

**What this is:** A second security step when logging in (usually a code sent to your phone).

**Why it matters:** Even if someone steals your password, they can't access your account without the code.

**How to enable it:**

* Facebook: Settings > Security and Login > Two-Factor Authentication
* Instagram: Settings and privacy > Security > Two-factor authentication

## Privacy for Specific Situations

## If You're Job Hunting

Employers often check social media before hiring.

**Protect yourself:**

1. Make sure your profile is set to Friends only.
2. Review photos you're tagged in—remove any that look unprofessional.
3. Consider using a professional photo as your profile picture.
4. Review your posts for anything that might concern an employer.
5. Some people create separate professional accounts (like LinkedIn) and keep Facebook for personal connections only.

## If You're Going Through a Breakup or Divorce

**Extra privacy steps:**

1. Review who can see your posts—consider removing your ex from your friends list.
2. Change your relationship status to private or leave it blank.
3. Adjust who can see old photos with your ex.
4. Consider taking a break from social media entirely during this time.

## If You're Concerned About Stalking or Harassment

**Immediate steps:**

1. Block the person immediately (their profile > three dots > Block).
2. Make all your settings as private as possible.
3. Review your friends list and remove anyone you don't fully trust.
4. Consider making a new account with a different name.
5. Report the harassment to the platform and, if serious, to police.

## Common Questions

**Q: If I make my Facebook private, can friends of friends still see my posts?**  
A: Only if you set posts to "Friends of friends." If you set them to "Friends only," then no, friends of friends cannot see them.

**Q: Can people see if I view their Instagram profile?**  
A: No. Instagram does not notify people when you look at their profile. However, if you watch their story, they can see you viewed it.

**Q: What's the difference between unfriending and blocking someone?**  
A: Unfriending removes them from your friends list, but they can still see public posts and send a new friend request. Blocking prevents them from seeing your profile, posts, or contacting you at all.

**Q: I made my Instagram private. Can people still see my old posts?**  
A: If your account is private, new people cannot see your posts. People who were already following you can still see everything unless you remove them as followers.

**Q: Can I make only certain posts visible to certain people?**  
A: Yes. When creating a post, use the privacy selector to choose who sees it. You can select specific people or create custom friend lists.

**Q: If someone tags me in a photo, who can see it?**  
A: It depends on the tagger's privacy settings and whether you approve the tag. If you have "review tags" turned on, you can prevent it from appearing on your profile.

**Q: Will my friends be notified if I change my privacy settings?**  
A: No. Changing your privacy settings is silent. However, they might notice they can no longer see certain posts or information.

**Q: Can I temporarily hide my Facebook profile?**  
A: Yes, you can deactivate your account. Go to Settings > Your Facebook Information > Deactivation and Deletion. Deactivation hides your profile but keeps your data. You can reactivate anytime by logging back in.

**Q: Does making my posts "Friends only" protect me from screenshots?**  
A: No. Anyone who can see your post can screenshot it. Privacy settings limit who can see something, but they can't prevent sharing once someone has access.

**Q: What happens to my privacy settings if Facebook updates?**  
A: Sometimes Facebook resets settings or adds new features with default settings you might not want. This is why regular privacy checkups (every 3-6 months) are important.

Taking control of your privacy settings doesn't mean you have to stop using social media. It means using it more safely. These changes give you more control over your personal information while still letting you stay connected with the people who matter. Privacy isn't about being secretive—it's about being careful. You deserve to decide who sees your life, not have it decided for you.
