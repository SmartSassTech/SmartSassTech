## Common Questions

## Do I need cable or satellite to use Roku?

No! Roku replaces cable/satellite. You only need internet connection. This is called "cutting the cord."

## Is Roku free?

The Roku device costs $25-100 (one-time purchase). No monthly fee for Roku itself. You pay for streaming services you want (Netflix, Hulu, etc.), but many free channels available.

## Can I watch regular TV channels on Roku?

Yes! Many local news apps available. Live TV streaming services like YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, or Sling TV offer cable-like channels. Some free options like Pluto TV offer live channels.

## What internet speed do I need?

Minimum 3 Mbps for standard definition, 5 Mbps for HD, 25 Mbps for 4K. Most home internet plans are sufficient.

## Can I use Roku without internet?

No, Roku requires internet connection to stream content. It does not store shows locally.

## Can I watch Amazon Prime Video on Roku?

Yes! Prime Video is available as a channel. If you have Amazon Prime membership, you can watch included content for free.

## How do I cancel subscriptions?

Depends where you subscribed. If through Roku: Settings → Subscriptions. If through service directly (like Netflix.com): cancel on their website.

## Can I use Roku at a hotel or RV?

Yes, but connecting to hotel Wi-Fi can be tricky due to login pages. Roku Hotel & Dorm Connect feature helps. Check Roku website for instructions.

## What's the difference between Roku models?

All do the same basic streaming. More expensive models are faster, support 4K/HDR, have better remotes, and include ethernet ports. Express is fine for most people.
