Is your internet slow or not working? Most Wi-Fi problems can be solved in minutes with a simple restart.

## 1. The "Magic Fix": Restart Everything

Before trying anything complex, do this. It fixes 80% of connection issues.

1. **Unplug your Router and Modem** from the power outlet.
2. **Wait 30 seconds**. (This clears common glitches).
3. **Plug the Modem back in first**. Wait 1-2 minutes for lights to stabilize.
4. **Plug the Router back in**. Wait 2 minutes for it to boot up.
5. **Restart your computer or phone**.

## Did that work?

* **Yes:** Great! You're done.
* **No:** Try the steps below.

## 2. Check for Internet Outages

If **none** of your devices can connect, the problem is likely with your Internet Service Provider (ISP), not your equipment.

* Turn off Wi-Fi on your phone and use cellular data.
* Search for "[Your Provider] outage" or check their app.
* **Common Support Numbers:**
  * **Xfinity/Comcast:** 1-800-934-6489
  * **Spectrum:** 1-833-267-6094
  * **AT&T:** 1-800-288-2020
  * **Verizon Fios:** 1-800-837-4966
  * **Cox:** 1-800-234-3993

## 3. "Forget" and Rejoin the Network

If you are connected but the internet is "No Internet" or very slow, resetting the connection often helps.

## Instructions by Device

* **iPhone/iPad**: [How to forget a Wi-Fi network](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208941)
* **Mac**: [Remove a Wi-Fi network on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/remove-a-wi-fi-network-mchlp1201/mac)
* **Windows**: [Manage Wi-Fi network profiles](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/manage-wireless-network-profiles-in-windows-10-96530663-3063-4409-943b-3129f12330a1)

## 4. Reset Network Settings (Last Resort)

This will delete all saved Wi-Fi passwords and refresh your connection settings. **Only do this if nothing else works.**

* **iPhone/iPad**: Settings > General > Transfer or Reset > Reset > **Reset Network Settings**. ([Apple Guide](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204051))
* **Android**: Settings > System > Reset options > **Reset Wi-Fi, mobile & Bluetooth**. ([Google Guide](https://support.google.com/android/answer/2657784))
* **Windows**: Settings > Network & Internet > **Network Reset**. ([Microsoft Guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/fix-wi-fi-connection-issues-in-windows-9424a1f7-6a3b-65a6-4d78-7f07eee84d2c))
* **Mac**: System Settings > Network. (Old settings are usually deleted significantly differently on newer macOS; refer to [Troubleshoot Wi-Fi on Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202222)).

## 5. Improving Your Signal

If your Wi-Fi works but is just **slow** in certain rooms:

* **Move the Router**: High up and central is best. Not inside a cabinet or behind the TV.
* **Interference**: Keep away from microwaves and baby monitors.
* **5GHz vs 2.4GHz**: Use 5GHz (often named "NetworkName-5G") for speed near the router; use 2.4GHz for better range through walls.
