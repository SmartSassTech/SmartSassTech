## 2. Common Metrics Explained

Most trackers measure the same things. Here is what they mean:

* **Steps**: Tracks movement. Aim for a goal that feels right for you (e.g., 5,000 or 10,000 steps).
* **Heart Rate (BPM)**: Beats Per Minute.
  * *Resting*: Your heart rate when sitting still (usually 60-100).
  * *Active*: Your heart rate when exercising.
* **Sleep**: Tracks how long and how well you slept. Wear your tracker to bed to see this data.

## 3. quick Tips

* **Sync Daily**: Open the app on your phone once a day to save your data.
* **Keep it Clean**: Wipe the band and sensor with a damp cloth after sweating.
* **Charge It**: Most trackers need charging every few days. Apple Watches usually need daily charging.

## Common Questions

## Do I need to carry my phone with me?

Many are water-resistant (rain, handwashing OK). Some are waterproof (swimming OK). Check your device's specifications. Look for ratings like IP67 (splash-proof) or 5ATM (swim-proof).

## What if the numbers seem wrong?

Make sure you're wearing it correctly (snug but comfortable). Check that your personal info in the app is accurate (height, weight, age). Restart the device if needed. Remember that trackers estimate—they're not perfect.

## Can I wear it all the time?

Yes, most people wear them 24/7 except when charging. If you get skin irritation, take breaks or switch wrists. Clean the tracker and your wrist regularly.

## Will it track automatically or do I have to press something?

Steps, heart rate, and sleep track automatically. For exercise, most auto-detect activities, but you can manually start a workout for more accurate data.

* Motivate yourself to move a bit more each day
* Understand your sleep patterns and quality

* Celebrate small improvements

## Important reminders
