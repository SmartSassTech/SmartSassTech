## Understanding Instagram

Think of Instagram as a digital photo album that you share with friends and family, except instead of passing around physical pictures, everyone sees them instantly on their phones. You can also see what others are sharing—like a constantly updating bulletin board of photos and short videos.

**Key Instagram Concepts:**

* **Posts:** Photos or videos you share that stay on your profile permanently (unless you delete them).
* **Stories:** Photos or videos that disappear after 24 hours (more casual, everyday moments).
* **Feed:** The main screen showing posts from people you follow, displayed in order.
* **Profile:** Your personal page showing your username, bio, and all your posts.
* **Followers:** People who have chosen to see your posts.
* **Following:** People whose posts you've chosen to see.

**What Makes Instagram Different from Facebook:**

* Instagram is image-focused (photos and videos come first, text is secondary).
* Content feels more casual and visual.
* Stories disappear after 24 hours (Facebook posts stay forever unless deleted).
* Instagram is owned by Facebook/Meta, so some features overlap.

## Step 2: Creating Your Account

## Signing Up

1. Open the Instagram app (or go to instagram.com).
2. Tap **Sign Up** (or **Create New Account**).
3. You'll be asked how you want to sign up—choose one:
   * **Sign up with Email:** Enter your email address.
   * **Sign up with Phone Number:** Enter your mobile number.
   * **Sign up with Facebook:** If you have Facebook, this imports your info automatically.

**Recommendation:** Use your email address—it's easier for password recovery.

## Entering Your Information

1. **Enter your email or phone number** and tap **Next**.
2. **Enter a name.** This can be your real name or a nickname (you can change it later).
3. **Create a password.** Make it:

   * Something you'll remember (write it down in a safe place)
4. **Save your login info?** You'll be asked if you want Instagram to remember your login. Tap **Save** for convenience or **Not Now** if sharing a device with others.

## Choosing a Username

Your username is your Instagram "handle"—how others find and tag you. It appears as @username.

**Tips for choosing a username:**

* Must be unique (no one else has it).
* Can include letters, numbers, periods, and underscores.
* No spaces allowed.
* Examples: @john.smith, @grandma_sue, @happytraveler2024

**Keep it simple:** Choose something you can easily tell people over the phone.

1. Type your desired username.
2. If taken, Instagram suggests alternatives (like adding numbers).
3. Tap **Next** when you find an available one you like.

## Adding Your Birthday

1. Instagram asks for your date of birth (required to comply with age restrictions).
2. **Privacy note:** Your birthday isn't shown publicly—it's only for verification.
3. Select your birth month, day, and year.
4. Tap **Next**.

## Verification (If Prompted)

Sometimes Instagram asks you to verify you're human:

1. You might receive a code via email or text.
2. Enter the 6-digit code shown in the message.
3. Tap **Confirm** or **Next**.

1. Go to **Settings and privacy** > **Messages and story replies**.
2. Tap **Show activity status**.
3. Toggle it **off** (gray).

## Controlling Story Viewers

## 🛡️ Safety Tip: Protecting Your Privacy on Instagram

* **Don't share your home address or exact location** in posts or captions.
* **Be cautious with strangers.** Don't accept follow requests or messages from people you don't know.
* **Never share your password** with anyone.
* **Turn on Two-Factor Authentication:** Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication. This adds extra protection to your account.
* **Review tagged photos.** Go to Settings > Tags and mentions > **Manually approve tags** so you control what appears on your profile.
* **Be careful with personal information.** Don't post photos of credit cards, IDs, boarding passes, or anything with sensitive details.

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between a post and a Story?**  
A: **Posts** stay on your profile permanently until you delete them. **Stories** disappear after 24 hours and are more casual/temporary.

**Q: Can I delete a post after sharing it?**  
A: Yes. Go to the post, tap the **three dots** (top-right), and select **Delete**. It's removed permanently.

**Q: How do I know if someone unfollowed me?**  
A: Instagram doesn't notify you. You'd need to manually check your followers list or use a third-party app (not recommended for security reasons).

**Q: What does "Close Friends" mean?**  
A: Close Friends is a custom list you create. Stories shared to Close Friends are only visible to people on that list (indicated by a green ring).

**Q: Can I use Instagram on multiple devices?**  
A: Yes. Log in with your username and password on any device. You can be logged in on your phone, tablet, and computer simultaneously.

**Q: What are hashtags and should I use them?**  
A: Hashtags (#) are keywords that categorize content (e.g., #gardening, #travel). They help people discover your posts. Use relevant hashtags in your captions (up to 30 per post, but 5-10 is typical).

**Q: How do I save a draft instead of posting immediately?**  
A: When creating a post, tap the **back arrow** instead of Share. Instagram asks if you want to **Save Draft**. Tap **Save**. Access drafts next time you create a post—they appear in your gallery with a "Draft" label.

**Q: Can I schedule posts in advance?**  
A: Not directly in the Instagram app. You'd need to use third-party tools like Meta Business Suite (free) or Later, Buffer, or Hootsuite (some paid).

**Q: What's the difference between "Following" and "Followers"?**  
A: **Following** = accounts you've chosen to follow (you see their content). **Followers** = people who have chosen to follow you (they see your content).

**Q: How do I report inappropriate content or accounts?**  
A: Tap the **three dots** on a post or profile > **Report**. Instagram reviews reports and takes action if content violates their policies.

**Q: Can I see who viewed my posts?**  
A: You can see who liked and commented, but Instagram doesn't show a full list of viewers for regular posts. However, you **can** see who viewed your **Stories** (swipe up while viewing your own Story).

**Q: Is Instagram free?**  
A: Yes, Instagram is completely free. There are no subscription fees. (Note: You may see paid ads while scrolling, but the platform itself is free.)
