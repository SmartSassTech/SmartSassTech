Learn the basics of email, from sending your first message to staying organized and safe.

## What Is Email?

Email (electronic mail) is a way to send messages and files over the internet. Think of it like sending a letter, but it arrives instantly.

**Key parts of email:**

* **Email address:** Your unique identifier (like <yourname@gmail.com>)
* **Inbox:** Where you receive messages
* **Compose:** Where you write new messages
* **Sent:** Messages you've sent to others

## Understanding Email Addresses

Every email address has the same format:

**<username@provider.com>**

* **Username:** Your chosen name (john.smith, sarahj, cooldude123)
* **@:** Required symbol that separates username from provider
* **Provider:** The email service (gmail.com, outlook.com, yahoo.com)

**Examples:**

* <john.smith@gmail.com>
* <sarah.jones@outlook.com>
* <mike.wilson@yahoo.com>

**Important:** Email addresses are NOT case-sensitive. <JOHN@GMAIL.COM> is the same as <john@gmail.com>.

## Popular Email Services

Choose an email provider to get started:

* **Gmail** (gmail.com) — Made by Google, most popular, works well with Android
* **Outlook** (outlook.com) — Made by Microsoft, works well with Windows
* **Yahoo Mail** (yahoo.com) — One of the oldest, still widely used
* **iCloud Mail** (icloud.com) — Made by Apple, works well with iPhone/Mac
* **ProtonMail** (proton.me) — Privacy-focused with encryption

**Most are free.** You can have multiple email addresses from different providers.

## How to Send an Email

The basic process is the same across all email services.

## Step 1: Click "Compose" or "New Message"

Look for a button that says:

* **Compose** (Gmail)
* **New message** (Outlook)
* **New** (Yahoo)
* Usually a pencil or plus icon on mobile

## Step 2: Fill in the "To" Field

* Type the recipient's full email address
* **Example:** <sarah.jones@gmail.com>
* **Be careful:** Double-check for typos—emails go where you type, even if wrong

**Sending to multiple people:** Separate addresses with commas

* **Example:** <john@gmail.com>, <sarah@yahoo.com>, <mike@outlook.com>

## Step 3: Add a Subject Line

* Brief description of what your email is about
* **Good examples:**
  * "Meeting on Tuesday"
  * "Question about the project"
  * "Family reunion plans"
* **Bad examples:**
  * "Hi" (too vague)
  * Leaving it blank (looks unprofessional or like spam)

## Step 4: Write Your Message

Type your message in the large text box.

**Basic email structure:**

1. **Greeting:** "Hi Sarah," or "Dear Mr. Smith,"
2. **Body:** Your main message
3. **Closing:** "Thanks," "Best regards," or "Talk soon,"
4. **Your name**

**Example:**

```text
Hi Sarah,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check if you're still available 
for lunch on Tuesday at noon. Let me know what works for you!

Thanks,
John
```

## Step 5: Add Attachments (Optional)

To send files (photos, documents, etc.):

* Look for a **paperclip icon** or "Attach" button
* Click it and select files from your computer
* Wait for the upload to complete before sending

**File size limits:** Most services limit attachments to 25MB. For larger files, use Google Drive, Dropbox, or WeTransfer.

## Step 6: Send

Click the **Send** button (often looks like a paper airplane on mobile).

**Before you send, double-check:**

* Recipient's email address is correct
* Subject line makes sense
* Message is clear and complete
* Attachments are attached (if mentioned in your message)

## Understanding CC and BCC

When sending to multiple people, you have options:

## To

* Primary recipients
* Everyone sees who else received the email

## CC (Carbon Copy)

* People who should see the email but aren't the main recipients
* Everyone can see who was CC'd
* **Use when:** Keeping your boss in the loop, sharing info with a team

## BCC (Blind Carbon Copy)

* Recipients are hidden from everyone else
* No one knows who else received the email
* **Use when:** Sending to a large group who don't know each other, protecting privacy

**Example:** You're sending a party invitation to 50 people. Use BCC so everyone's email address stays private.

## How to Reply to an Email

## Reply

* Click **Reply**
* Sends a response only to the person who sent the original email
* Original message usually appears below your response

## Reply All

* Click **Reply All**
* Sends a response to everyone who received the original email
* **Be careful:** Don't hit "Reply All" if your message is only for one person

**Common mistake:** Accidentally hitting "Reply All" and sending a private message to everyone. Always check which button you're clicking!

## Forward

* Click **Forward**
* Sends the email to someone new who wasn't on the original email
* **Use when:** Sharing information with someone who wasn't included

## Organizing Your Inbox

Keep your email manageable with these strategies:

## Use Folders or Labels

Group related emails together:

* **Work**
* **Personal**
* **Bills**
* **Family**
* **Travel**

**How to create:**

* **Gmail:** Use labels (sidebar > "Create new label")
* **Outlook:** Use folders (right-click on Inbox > "New folder")

## Archive Old Emails

* **Archive** removes emails from your inbox but keeps them searchable
* **Don't delete everything**—you might need it later
* **Delete** only spam or emails you're certain you won't need

## Use Search

Can't find an email? Use the search bar at the top:

* Search by sender: "from:sarah@gmail.com"
* Search by subject: "subject:meeting"
* Search by keyword: Just type words from the email

## Unsubscribe from Unwanted Emails

Getting too many promotional emails?

* Scroll to the bottom of the email
* Click **Unsubscribe**
* Legitimate companies are required to include this

**Don't mark as spam if you signed up for it**—just unsubscribe.

## Email Safety Tips

Protect yourself from scams and hackers:

## Watch Out for Phishing Emails

Phishing emails try to trick you into giving up passwords or personal information.

**Warning signs:**

* Unexpected emails asking you to "verify your account"
* Urgent language: "Act now or your account will be closed!"
* Generic greetings: "Dear Customer" instead of your name
* Suspicious links or attachments
* Sender's email doesn't match the company (paypa1.com instead of paypal.com)

**What to do:**

* **Don't click links** in suspicious emails
* **Don't download attachments** from unknown senders
* **Go directly to the website** by typing the address yourself
* **Report as spam/phishing** using your email service's tools

## Never Share Your Password

* No legitimate company will ever ask for your password via email
* Don't reply to emails requesting your password, SSN, or credit card info
* When in doubt, contact the company directly using official channels

## Be Careful What You Send

* Email is NOT private—it can be forwarded, screenshotted, or hacked
* Don't email sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or SSNs
* Assume anything you email could be seen by others

## Use Strong Passwords and 2FA

* Use a unique, strong password for your email (see our password guide)
* Enable two-factor authentication (see our 2FA guide)
* **Why it matters:** Your email is the key to all your other accounts

## Email Etiquette

Follow these rules to communicate professionally and respectfully:

## Be Professional

* Use proper grammar and spelling (especially for work emails)
* Avoid ALL CAPS (it looks like shouting)
* Keep it brief and to the point

## Respond in a Timely Manner

* Try to reply within 24-48 hours
* If you need more time, send a quick note: "I got your email and will respond by Friday"

## Use Clear Subject Lines

* Make it easy for people to know what your email is about
* Update the subject if the conversation changes topics

## Be Careful with Humor and Tone

* Sarcasm doesn't translate well in email
* What you think is funny might be misunderstood
* When in doubt, be straightforward and polite

## Proofread Before Sending

* Read your email out loud to catch errors
* Make sure your tone is appropriate
* Check that you're sending to the right people

## Managing Email on Your Phone

Most email apps work similarly on smartphones:

## Popular Apps

* **Gmail app** (iOS/Android) — Works with all email providers
* **Outlook app** (iOS/Android) — Microsoft's email app
* **Mail app** (iPhone) — Apple's built-in email app
* **Yahoo Mail app** (iOS/Android)

## Mobile Email Tips

* **Swipe gestures:** Swipe left/right to delete or archive (check your app's settings)
* **Notifications:** Turn them on for important emails, off for newsletters
* **Push vs. Fetch:** Push gives instant notifications, Fetch saves battery
* **Signature:** Add a mobile signature: "Sent from my iPhone" or your name

## Common Email Problems

## "Message Not Delivered" Error

* **Check the email address** for typos
* **Check spelling of domain:** Is it .com or .net?
* **Try again later:** The recipient's server might be down

## Not Receiving Emails

* **Check spam/junk folder**—emails often get filtered there
* **Check filters/rules**—you may have accidentally created a rule
* **Check storage**—some providers stop receiving emails when storage is full

## Accidentally Sent Email

* **Look for "Undo Send"** — Gmail and Outlook have a few seconds to undo
* **Send a follow-up** explaining the mistake if you can't undo

## Forgot Password

* Click **Forgot Password** on the login screen
* Follow the recovery process (usually email or phone verification)
* Set up recovery options in advance (backup email, phone number)

## Quick Email Checklist

* **Do** use clear subject lines
* **Do** proofread before sending
* **Do** reply in a reasonable timeframe
* **Do** be cautious with Reply All
* **Do** check spam folder regularly
* **Don't** open suspicious attachments
* **Don't** share your password
* **Don't** send sensitive information via email
* **Don't** forget to attach files you mention
* **Don't** use email when angry—wait and cool down first
