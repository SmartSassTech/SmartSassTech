title: Simple Habits for Staying Safe Online
---

Protect yourself from scams, hackers, and privacy threats with these simple habits.

## 1. Think Before You Click

Most online dangers start with a single click on something suspicious.

* **Phishing emails:** Don't click links in unexpected emails, even if they look official. Go directly to the website instead.
* **Pop-ups:** Close suspicious pop-ups (don't click "OK" or "Cancel"—click the X or close the browser tab).
* **Too-good-to-be-true offers:** If something promises you money, prizes, or deals that sound impossible, it's a scam.
* **Why it works:** Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking. Slow down and verify first.

## 2. Keep Everything Updated

Outdated software is like leaving your front door unlocked.

* **Turn on automatic updates** for your operating system (Windows, macOS, iOS, Android).
* **Update your apps** regularly—especially browsers, messaging apps, and security software.
* **Why it works:** Updates fix security holes that hackers exploit.

## 3. Watch What You Share

Once something is online, it's there forever—even if you delete it.

* **Social media:** Don't post your full birthday, address, phone number, or vacation plans while you're away.
* **Private information:** Never share passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers via email or text.
* **Strangers online:** Be cautious about who you trust. People may not be who they claim to be.
* **Why it works:** Scammers and identity thieves collect personal information to steal from you or impersonate you.

## 4. Use Secure Connections

Not all internet connections are safe.

* **Look for HTTPS:** Before entering passwords or payment info, make sure the website address starts with `https://` and shows a lock icon.
* **Public Wi-Fi:** Avoid banking or shopping on public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports). If you must, use a VPN (Virtual Private Network).
* **Why it works:** Secure connections encrypt your data so hackers can't intercept it.

## 5. Install Security Software

Basic protection goes a long way.

* **Windows Users:** Windows Defender (built-in) is solid protection—keep it enabled.
* **Mac Users:** macOS has built-in protection, but consider Malwarebytes for extra scanning.
* **All Users:** Use a reputable antivirus like Norton, Bitdefender, or Malwarebytes.
* **Why it works:** Security software catches threats before they can harm your device.

## 6. Back Up Your Important Files

Ransomware and hard drive failures happen. Don't lose everything.

* **Cloud backup:** Use iCloud, Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox for automatic backups.
* **External drive:** Keep a physical backup on an external hard drive (disconnect it when not in use).
* **Why it works:** If you're hacked or your device dies, you won't lose your photos, documents, and memories.

## 7. Be Smart on Social Media

Scammers and hackers love social media.

* **Privacy settings:** Lock down your profiles so only friends can see your posts.
* **Friend requests:** Don't accept requests from people you don't know, especially if they're claiming to be someone you already have as a friend (it's likely a fake account).
* **Links from friends:** If a friend sends you a weird link out of the blue, their account may be hacked—don't click it. Message them separately to check.

## Quick Tips

* **Do** log out of accounts when using shared or public computers.
* **Do** check your bank and credit card statements regularly for unauthorized charges.
* **Don't** download attachments from unknown senders.
* **Don't** use the same password for multiple accounts (see our password guide).
* **Do** enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible.

## If You Think You've Been Hacked

1. **Change your passwords immediately** (starting with email and banking).
2. **Run a full antivirus scan** on your device.
3. **Check your accounts** for unauthorized activity.
4. **Contact your bank** if you suspect financial fraud.
5. **Report it:** File a report with the FTC at [IdentityTheft.gov](https://www.identitytheft.gov/).
