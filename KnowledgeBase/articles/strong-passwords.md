title: Create Strong Passwords and Keep Them Safe
---

Protect your accounts with passwords that are hard to crack but easy to remember.

## 1. The Strategy: Use Passphrases

Instead of complicated nonsense like `P@ssw0rd1!`, use a **Passphrase**. Pick 3-4 random words that have nothing to do with each other.

* *Example:* `Correct-Horse-Battery-Staple`
* *Example:* `Blue-Coffee-Jump-99`
* **Why it works:** It makes the password extremely long (hard for computers to crack) but easy for you to visualize (easy to remember).

## 2. Don't Reuse Passwords

If you use the same password for everything and one site gets hacked, hackers have access to **everything**.

* **Rule:** Every account gets a unique password.

## 3. Use a Password Manager

You can't remember unique passwords for 50+ websites. Use a tool to do it for you.

* **Apple Users:** Use **iCloud Keychain** (built-in and free).
* **Android/Chrome Users:** Use **Google Password Manager** (built-in and free).
* **Dedicated Apps:** 1Password, Bitwarden, or LastPass are excellent options that work on all devices.

## 4. Turn on Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

This adds a second lock to your door. Even if someone steals your password, they can't get in without the code sent to your phone.

* Enable it for your **Email**, **Bank**, and **Social Media**.

## Quick Tips

* **Don't** use family names, pet names, or birthdays.
* **Don't** write passwords on sticky notes on your monitor.
* **Do** write them in a physical notebook *if* you keep it safe at home.
