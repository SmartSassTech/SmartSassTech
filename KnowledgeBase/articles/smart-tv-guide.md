title: How to Use Your Smart TV
---

Today's TVs do much more than just show cable channels. Smart TVs and streaming devices let you watch Netflix, YouTube, and thousands of other apps—all without connecting a computer. This guide covers the basics of using your TV and where to find detailed help for your specific device.

## Quick Start: The Basics

## 1. What is a "Smart" TV?

A smart TV connects directly to the internet (via Wi-Fi or Ethernet) to run apps like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. It works like a smartphone or tablet, but on a bigger screen.

## 2. Switching Inputs (Source)

If you see a black screen or "No Signal," you are likely on the wrong input.

* **Press the "Input" or "Source" button** on your remote.
* Select the port where your device is plugged in (e.g., HDMI 1 for Cable, HDMI 2 for Roku).
* *Tip: Label your inputs in the TV settings to make them easier to find.*

## 3. Using the Remote

Most remotes share common buttons:

* **Home (House Icon):** Returns you to the main menu/app list.
* **Back (Arrow/Return):** Goes back to the previous screen.
* **OK / Select:** Selects the highlighted item.
* **Microphone:** Activates voice search (if available).

## Common Troubleshooting

## TV Won't Turn On

1. Check that the power cable is firmly plugged in at both ends.
2. Try a different power outlet.
3. Replace the batteries in your remote.
4. Try the physical power button on the TV itself (often hidden on the side or bottom).

## No Picture / "No Signal"

1. Ensure your streaming device or cable box is powered on (check for a light).
2. Cycle through inputs using the **Source/Input** button on your TV remote.
3. Unplug the HDMI cable and plug it back in firmly.

## Buffering or Freezing

1. **Restart your TV/Device:** Go to Settings > System > Restart, or unplug it for 30 seconds.
2. **Restart your Router:** Unplug your Wi-Fi router for 30 seconds and plug it back in.
3. **Check Speed:** Ensure your internet speed is sufficient (5 Mbps for HD, 25 Mbps for 4K).

## App Crashes

1. Check for app updates in the TV's app store.
2. Uninstall and reinstall the app.
3. Check if the streaming service is down (search "Is Netflix down?" on your phone).

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to pay for streaming apps?

Many apps (Netflix, Disney+, Hulu) require a paid subscription. Others (YouTube, Pluto TV, Tubi) are free with ads.

## Can I watch regular live TV?

Yes. You can plug in a cable box or digital antenna and switch the input to "TV" or "Antenna". You can also subscribe to live TV streaming services like YouTube TV, Sling, or Hulu + Live TV.

## How do I stop ads on the home screen?

Most smart TV platforms display ads by default. You can often limit targeted ad tracking in the **Privacy** or **About** section of your TV's settings.

## My remote isn't working/pairing

First, replace the batteries. If that fails, look up the "pairing process" for your specific remote model using the links in the [Device-Specific Guides](#device-specific-guides--support) section above.
